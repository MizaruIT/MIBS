         end-systems, as well as objects that apply only to ATM switches.
         In all the following descriptions of objects,
         CLP-0 means Cell Loss Priority = 0, and
         CLP-1 means Cell Loss Priority = 1.
         ATM cells with CLP=0 have a higher priority in regard to cell
         loss than ATM cells with CLP=1.  Therefore, during resource
         congestions, CLP=1 cells are dropped before any CLP=0 cell is
         dropped.
         Ingress direction means coming from network to the switch.
