--    This module manages Cisco's intercept feature for 
--    802 (layer 2) streams.
--    
--    This MIB is used along with CISCO-TAP2-MIB to
--    intercept 802 traffic. CISCO-TAP2-MIB along with
--    specific filter MIBs like this MIB replace
--    CISCO-TAP-MIB.
--    
--    To create an 802 intercept, an entry c802tapStreamEntry 
--    is created which contains the filter details. An entry
--    cTap2StreamEntry of CISCO-TAP2-MIB is created which 
--    is the common stream information for all kinds of 
--    intercepts and type of the specific stream is set to
--    mac in this entry.

        "This object displays what types of intercept streams can be
        configured on this type of device. This may be dependent on
        hardware capabilities, software capabilities. The following
        fields may be supported:
            tapEnable:   set if table entries with
                         cTap2StreamInterceptEnable set to 'false'
                         are used to pre-screen packets for intercept;
                         otherwise these entries are ignored.
            interface:   SNMP ifIndex Value may be used to select
                         interception of all data crossing an
                         interface or set of interfaces.
            dstMacAddr:  Destination MAC Address may be used to select
                         traffic to be intercepted.
            srcMacAddr:  Source MAC Address may be used to select
                         traffic to be intercepted.
            ethernetPid: Ethernet Protocol Identifier may be used to
                         select traffic to be intercepted.
            dstLlcSap:   IEEE 802.2 Destination SAP may be used to
                         select traffic to be intercepted.
            srcLlcSap:   IEEE 802.2 Source SAP may be used to select
                         traffic to be intercepted."

    DESCRIPTION
        "The Intercept Stream 802 Table lists the IEEE 802 data streams
        to be intercepted.  The same data stream may be required by
        multiple taps, and one might assume that often the intercepted
        stream is a small subset of the traffic that could be
        intercepted.
        
        This essentially provides options for packet selection, only
        some of which might be used. For example, if all traffic to or
        from a given interface is to be intercepted, one would
        configure an entry which lists the interface, and wild-card
        everything else.  If all traffic to or from a given MAC Address
        is to be intercepted, one would configure two such entries
        listing the MAC Address as source and destination respectively,
        and wild-card everything else.
        
        The first index indicates which Mediation Device the
        intercepted traffic will be diverted to. The second index
        permits multiple classifiers to be used together, such as
        having a MAC address as source or destination.
        
        Entries are added to this table via c802tapStreamStatus in 
        accordance with the RowStatus convention."

c802tapStreamInterface OBJECT-TYPE
    SYNTAX INTEGER(-1|0|1..2147483647)
    ACCESS read-write
    STATUS mandatory
    DESCRIPTION
        "The ifIndex value of the interface over which traffic to be
        intercepted is received or transmitted. The interface may be
        physical or virtual. If this is the only parameter specified,
        and it is other than -1 or 0, all traffic on the selected
        interface will be chosen.
        
        If the value is zero, matching traffic may be received or
        transmitted on any interface.  Additional selection parameters
        must be selected to limit the scope of traffic intercepted.
        This is most useful on non-routing platforms or on intercepts
        placed elsewhere than a subscriber interface.
        
        If the value is -1, one or both of
        c802tapStreamDestinationAddress and c802tapStreamSourceAddress
        must be specified.  Matching traffic on the interface pointed
        to by the dot1dTpFdbPort values associated with those values is
        intercepted, whichever is specified.  If dot1dTpFdbPort
        changes, either by operator action or by protocol events, the
        interface will change with it. This is primarily intended for
        use on subscriber interfaces and other places where routing is
        guaranteed to be symmetrical.
        
        In both of these cases, it is possible to have the same packet
        selected for intersection on both its ingress and egress
        interface.  Nonetheless, only one instance of the packet is
        sent to the Mediation Device.
        
        This value must be set when creating a stream entry, either to
        select an interface, to select all interfaces, or to select the
        interface that bridging learns. Some platforms may not
        implement the entire range of options."
