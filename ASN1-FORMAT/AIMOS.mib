      DESCRIPTION 
        "The MIB is divided into ranges with different rights of access, in order not
        to grant any person access to the entire data. The protected main part of the
        information is located in the branch aimosObjects and can be accessed only
        after an authorising of the user, called login.
        
        The areas are accessible as follows:
         The public area aimosPublic is accessible without any restrictions.It serves
          mainly to prepare the login procedure.
        
         aimosLogin can be accessed only with special community names generated by the
          A.I.M.O.S. SNMP Agent. Here the login takes place. This authorising takes place
          via username and password. A valid user/password combination combined with a
          community name generated by the agent is called a session after the login has
          take place. The main part of the MIB (off aimosObjects downward) is permitted
          only within a valid session.
        
         aimosObjects contains the objects of the managed network elements. This area
          is accessible only after a successful login (that is within a valid session)
        
         aimosNotifications contains objects, which concern the alarm notifications.
        
         aimosGroups and aimosCompliances satisfies SNMP requirements.

        Release Q0215RHL
        Modifications:
        At time the MIB was designed only MMR was available. The yore network structure of the MMR 
        lead to the design of Trap Info fields. The Cable Trap Info was never implemented.
        
        From SNMP Manager's point of view it was somewhat complicated to extract the Trap Info from 
        notification objects, whereas the Trap Info for later introduced Network Element types 
        beneath the MMR (the Alarm Boards for example) where never forwarded with notifications.
        
        In V2.4.0 the SNMP Manager is provided with the Network Element's Trap Info, Component Name, 
        Location and Unique System ID in the former aimosAlarmListCustomer...Info fields. 
        
        Therefore the following object names change:
        - aimosAlarmListCustomerMasterInfo  -> aimosAlarmListTrapInfo
        - aimosAlarmListCustomerSubRackInfo -> aimosAlarmListComponentName
        - aimosAlarmListCustomerCableInfo   -> aimosAlarmListLocation
        - aimosAlarmListCustomerRemoteInfo  -> aimosAlarmListUniqueSystemID
        
        The same applies to the Alarm Log:
        - aimosAlarmLogCustomerMasterInfo  -> aimosAlarmLogTrapInfo
        - aimosAlarmLogCustomerSubRackInfo -> aimosAlarmLogComponentName
        - aimosAlarmLogCustomerCableInfo   -> aimosAlarmLogLocation
        - aimosAlarmLogCustomerRemoteInfo  -> aimosAlarmLogUniqueSystemID
        
        Additionally the notifications aimosAlarmNew, aimosAlarmChanged (still not used) as well 
        as aimosAlarmCleared are changed to contain the new object names.
        
        The old MIB design remains available in the '%AIMOS_ROOT%\MIB\LEGACY\AIMOS.MY'-MIB-File. 
        The A.I.M.O.S. SNMP Agent can be set to act as it did until V2.3 by means of the A.I.M.O.S. 
        Config-Tool: Set 'MIB supported by the Agent' to 'A.I.M.O.S. Legacy'."

      STATUS current
      DESCRIPTION 
        "The aimosLogin branch carries the leafs for logging in as a specific user.
        
        As above-mentioned access to the branch aimosLogin is only permitted with SNMP
        community set to a value published by aimosCommunity.
        
        Login process is performed by the following actions:
         Get SNMP community string from aimosCommunity using public as community name.
          Use this community name in further SNMP requests.
         Set the user name in aimosLoginUserName (use the new community name!)
         Set the corresponding password in aimosLoginPassword expect in the case of the
          first login after software installation.
          In that case a text in the following format has to be used as password:
                 nnnnnn xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx aaaaaaa
           where n is the OrgID
                 x is the license key
                 a is the license extra data (may be omitted)
         Set aimosLoginState to connected(1).
         Check the current aimosLoginState.
           If login was successful, then it is set to connected(1) state.
           If the password is wrong, then it is set to refused(2) state.
           If passwordExpired(4) is returned, the password has expired.
        
        Password expiration
        ===================
        All passwords are valid for an amount of days. This period of time is specified
        in aimosPasswordExpirationPeriod. If a password was unchanged for more than the
        specified number of days, then the password expires. Existing Sessions are not
        affected by the password expiration.
        
        When a password has expired, no login can be made for the corresponding user
        account, until the user has defined a new password.
        
        The new password has to be assigned to aimosLoginPassword in order to complete
        the login process. If the new password is permissible then
         this password is stored in aimosUserPassword and has to be used in the future
         and aimosLoginState gets connected(1).
        
        The default password (start) is expired by default. I.e., if the default password
        is used for login, the user needs to advise a new password as mentioned above.
        
        Due to the
         minimum password length requirements (aimosMinPasswordLength)
         or the reusability of passwords (aimosPasswordReuseCounter)
         as well as the requirements on password security (aimosPasswordStandard)
        it may be possible, that the new password is not acceptable by the A.I.M.O.S. SNMP
        Agent. In that case, the password remains expired and the user is required to
         devise another password and repeat this procedure until aimosLoginState gets
          connected(1)
         or cancel the login process by setting aimosLoginState to disconnected(0)
        
        Logout
        ======
        Set aimosLoginState to disconnected(0) in order to log out. After log out the
        community name is invalid and therefore aimosLoginState gets canceled(3).
        If you need to log in again, then you have to request for a new community name
        by the steps described above."

        "The user management contains all access authorisation related data of
        organisations and its user accounts.
        
        Each organisation may have user accounts. An user account is required
        in order to get access to the A.I.M.O.S. SNMP Agent. An user account having
        the required rights can be used in order to create further user accounts
        with similar or less access rights.
        
        Read and write access rights are defined per area and are combined in
        'roles'. The access rights of a user account are determined by assigning
        it to a certain role.
        
        The system is shipped with predefined organisations, user accounts, roles
        and its right assignments. Nevertheless the provider is responsible for the
        user management.

      STATUS current
      DESCRIPTION 
        "This is a short introduction in order to help you understand how the A.I.M.O.S.
        SNMP Agent realises SNMP alarm forwarding. When the A.I.M.O.S. SNMP Agent is
        informed about a failure in the monitored system, it must find out which SNMP
        Managers will have to get an alarm message. Each SNMP Manager who is to get the
        alarm message, requires an entry in the aimosPhoneBookTable. This entry contains
        the IP address used for alarm forwarding.
        
        Prior to the explanation on how the A.I.M.O.S. SNMP Agent determines the list of
        phone book entries which have to be informed about an active alarm, the three
        aspects with a decisive influence on this determination will be explained in
        the following:
        
         Alarms with similar characteristics will be put together in alarm groups.
          The alarm groups defined in the system are listed in the table
          aimosAlarmGroupTable. Via aimosAlarmAlarmGroupID each alarm is assigned to
          exactly one alarm group.
        
         The Provider can create work shifts and determine various alarm distribution
          rules in dependence of each work shift. The work shifts defined in the system
          are listed in the table aimosWorkShiftTable. The currently active work shift
          is set by each Organisation itself using the object aimosOrgActiveWorkShiftID
          in the aimosOrgTable.
        
         The third point of influence are the alarm recipient lists. Each Organisation
          defines its own alarm recipient lists by adding the according entries to the
          table aimosAlarmRecipientListTable. For each alarm recipient list the phone
          book entries assigned to it are listed in the
          aimosAlarmRecipientListMemberTable. One phone book entry (i.e. one SNMP
          Manager) can be assigned to several alarm recipient lists simultaneously.
        
        In order to get the list of SNMP Managers that have to be informed, the A.I.M.O.S.
        SNMP Agent proceeds as follows:
        
         The A.I.M.O.S. SNMP Agent checks the aimosAlarmConfigTable, and uses the object
          aimosAlarmAlarmGroupID in order to find out to which alarm group the alarm
          belongs.
        
         Next, it determines which Organisations are authorised to receive alarms of
          this alarm group. This information is laid down in the table
          aimosAlarmGroupAllowedOrgTable.
        
         The A.I.M.O.S. SNMP Agent checks the value of aimosAlarmForwardingType of each
          affected organisation in order to determine the organisations having alarm
          forwarding enabled as well as the kind of alarm forwarding to be used (SNMPv1
          trap or SNMPv2c notification).
        
         For each Organisation that is allowed (allowed org) and enabled (alarm
          forwarding enabled) to receive alarms, the current work shift is identified via
          the object aimosOrgActiveWorkShiftID.
        
         The table aimosAlarmDistributionPlanTable now shows which alarm recipient
          lists have to be used. The table provides one alarm recipient list per
          Organisation, AlarmGroup and work shift. If there is no entry for a certain
          combination, no alarm will be sent. If there is an entry, each member of the
          alarm recipient list (aimosAlarmRecipientListMemberTable) will receive an
          alarm notification, unless a phone book entry was deactivated via
          aimosPhoneBookActive.
        
        After the alarm recipients have been identified, the various counters required
        for sending traps must be identified:
        
         The aimosAlarmListAlarmEventID identifies the cause leading to the dispatch
          of a aimosAlarmNew or a aimosAlarmChanged notification to one or more SNMP
          Managers. Here, the counter will be increased by one for each cause. If the
          cause leads to sending a aimosAlarmCleared notification, the counter will not
          be increased. Instead, the count of the according aimosAlarmNew or (if present)
          the latest aimosAlarmChanged notification will be used.
        
         The aimosAlarmListID is identical to the aimosAlarmListAlarmEventID, as long
          as the aimosAlarmChanged alarm has not been implemented.
        
         The aimosAlarmTrapID uniquely identifies each notification that was not sent
          to an SNMP Manager.
        
         Each SNMP Manager can rely on the aimosAlarmTrapNotificationID to have a
          continuous numeration. If not, one notification got lost.
        
        At long last the A.I.M.O.S. SNMP Agent have to collect some information required
        to provide the notifications:
        
         The A.I.M.O.S. SNMP Agent have to inspect the aimosAlarmConfigTable (and in a
          future version of the A.I.M.O.S. SNMP Agent the aimosAlarmSeverityRangeTable) to
          determine the alarms severity (in the future version for each organisation).
        
         The A.I.M.O.S. SNMP Agent collects the organisation specific customer device
          information to be provided with the notification by means of the values of
          aimosMasterTrapInfo, aimosSubRackTrapInfo, aimosRemoteTrapInfo and
          aimosCableTrapInfo.
        
        Now the A.I.M.O.S. SNMP Agent has collected all information required for SNMP
        alarm forwarding. The A.I.M.O.S. SNMP Agent will now perform the following actions:
        
         Create one entry per organisation in the alarm list (aimosAlarmListTable)
          using the organisations ID (aimosOrgID) and the alarm List ID
          (aimosAlarmListID) as index.
        
         Send one SNMP notification to each manager discovered by the steps mentioned
          above and create for each notification one entry in the trap list
          (aimosAlarmTrapTable) using the organisations ID (aimosOrgID), the alarm List
          ID (aimosAlarmListID) and the trap ID (aimosAlarmTrapID) as index.
        
        Each manager have to acknowledge the received notifications by means of setting
        aimosAlarmTrapAcknowledgementState using its organisation ID (aimosOrgID), the
        alarm list ID (aimosAlarmListID) and the alarm trap ID (aimosAlarmTrapID) to
        acknowledged(2).
        
        After having emitted the alarm notification, the A.I.M.O.S. SNMP Agent expects an
        acknowledgement within a certain interval, that can be specified (in seconds) in
        aimosAlarmAckExpectInterval. If there is no such acknowledgement, the A.I.M.O.S.
        SNMP Agent will continue to emit the alarm until the acknowledgement is received.
        
        The notification remains in the alarm list
         as long as the based alarm event is active or
         if at least one notification related to the alarm event is not yet acknowledged
          by at least one of the involved SNMP Managers.
        
        The entries in the trap table (aimosAlarmTrapTable) are earlier removed: If a
        manager has performed the required acknowledgements, its entries in the trap
        table are removed.
        After remove from the trap and alarm list table, the removed entries are
        available in the alarm log (aimosAlarmLogTable). The specific alarm event ID
        will not be used again unless an alarm list rebuild resets the counter to zero
        or the wrap value (2남-1) is reached. If a similar or even the same alarm event
        occurs again (after the old one gets cleared), than the notification will not
        contain the formerly used alarm event ID but a new one."

        "This object of type RecognitionState states whether or not the alarm 
        has been recognized. Together with aimosAlarmListClearReason these
        objects are the only writeable values of this table.
        
        Recognition is used to indicate an 'I have seen the alarm and will 
        take care about it'. It is available via SNMP as well as via the 
        AIMOS_Visu's Supervision page. 
        
        Recognition by means of SNMP will be done by setting this value 
        to recognized(2). Due to the fact that alarms are moved from 
        aimosAlarmListTable to aimosAlarmLogTable as soon as they are both 
        cleared and acknowledged aimosAlarmLogRecognitionState provides means 
        to recognize cleared alarms; it is the only writeable alarm log object.
        
        A SET request with unrecognized(1) (i.e. 'Unrecognition') is an 
        invalid operation and will be rejected by the SNMP Agent.
        
        For each alarm recognition the SNMP Agent sends a aimosAlarmRecognized 
        trap to SNMP Managers having aimosPhoneBookRecognitionTraps set to true.
        
        On the other hand the similar sounding term 'acknowledgement' is 
        pertaining to the SNMP protocol: it provides means for the SNMP 
        manager to acknowledge trap receipt. 
        Please note: in case both the acknowledgement feature and the 
        recognition-traps-feature are active, even the recognition traps 
        have to be acknowledged.

      STATUS current
      DESCRIPTION
        "ATTENTION: Setting this objects value to start(5) will initiate an Alarm List
        Rebuild process. During this process ALL ALARM INFORMATION WILL BE DELETED !
        
        The Alarm List Rebuild process
        ==============================
        
        When an employee discovers that the internal alarm table of the A.I.M.O.S. SNMP
        Agent is flawed, an alarm list rebuild can be triggered. Such a process may also
        be necessary if productive operation is to start after a test phase with an empty
        alarm list.
        
        The Alarm List Rebuild consists of the following steps:
        
         A SNMP Manager sets aimosAlarmListRebuild to start(5). The logged in user
          must belong the Provider.
        
         The A.I.M.O.S. SNMP Agent drops the contents of the internal alarm tables. The
          table is completely deleted; each alarm list entry for each organisation is
          removed !
        
         The A.I.M.O.S. SNMP Agent resets each alarm notification related counter to
          zero. These counters are aimosAlarmListID, aimosAlarmListAlarmEventID,
          aimosAlarmTrapID and each managers aimosAlarmTrapNotificationID. The values of
          these counters are increased by one with each new alarm, i.e. with the first
          alarms the value is 1. A counter of 0 is only possible after the maximum value
          (2남-1) has been reached; which is, however, highly unlikely.
        
         The aimosAlarmListRebuildInitiated notification is forwarded to all SNMP
          Managers configured to receive this alarm. This will result in
           one new alarm list entry per affected organisation
            (with aimosAlarmListID and aimosAlarmListAlarmEventID each set to 1) and
           one trap list entry per affected manager
            (with aimosAlarmTrapNotificationID set to 1 and per SNMP Manager consecutive
            numbered values beginning with 1 in aimosAlarmTrapID)
        
         The A.I.M.O.S. devices are informed about the rebuild in order to reset its
          internal alarm tables, too. The devices will report still existing alarms as new
          alarms immediately.
        
         Suppress forwarding of further notifications to a specific manager until the
          manager acknowledges the aimosAlarmListRebuildInitiated notification. If the
          acknowledgement is missing for a specific period of time, the agent obviously
          emits the aimosAlarmListRebuildInitiated notification again
        
        On receipt of the aimosAlarmListRebuildInitiated notification, the SNMP Manager
        shall clean the internal alarm table prior to acknowledge this notification.
        
        There is no aimosAlarmCleared notification for this alarm. The alarm gets cleared
        on acknowledgement. Alarm notifications received after that acknowledgement needs
        to get acknowledged by the manager as usual; the manager is neither required nor
        able to distinguish if a notification is a result of the alarm list rebuild or a
        new (never received before) one.
        
        Changes, which are made here, affect all organizations.
        That's why TelCo's are not allowed to initiate an Alarm List Rebuild Process
        by setting this value to start(5)."

      DESCRIPTION
        "This object of type OperationMode is provided to give each SNMP Manager the
        ability to synchronise its alarm table.
        
        Setting this value to start(5) will start the alarm list synchronisation process.
        If the current SNMP Manager has more than one IP address or if his phonebook
        entry is 127.0.0.1, the SNMP Agent cannot determine for which phonebook entry
        the Alarm List Resync is to be done. In such a case 
        - either aimosPhoneBookAlarmListResync must be used 
        - or the aimosLoginPhoneBookID should be set manually (recommended)
        in order to start the Alarm List Resync Process.
        
        The Alarm List Resync process
        =============================
        
        When an employee discovers that the internal alarm table of the SNMP Manager is
        flawed, a resynchronisation of the alarm list can be initiated, which is e.g. the
        case when the trap count (aimosAlarmTrapNotificationID), which is continuous for
        each SNMP Manager, is interrupted.
        
        Each SNMP Manager receiving alarms is allowed to start a synchronisation of the
        alarm list. In order to do that the SNMP Manager shall first clean the internal
        alarm table and then request for an alarm list rebuild by setting
        aimosAlarmListResync to start(5).
        
        This request does not cause the agent to send a notification like the alarm list
        rebuild process will do, but the A.I.M.O.S. SNMP Agent will perform the following
        steps:
        
         Set the value of aimosAlarmListResync to running(3)
        
         It resets the managers aimosAlarmTrapNotificationID to zero
        
         All alarms in the alarm list related to the specific manager will be emit with
          unchanged aimosAlarmListID, aimosAlarmListAlarmEventID and aimosAlarmTrapID
          values. The aimosAlarmTrapNotificationID is a new generated consecutive
          numbered value. The agent doesn't wait for acknowledgement before emitting the
          next notification.
        
         If the last notification is sent to the manager, aimosAlarmListResync is set to
          idle(0)
        
        The manager is required to acknowledge all notifications as usual.
        An alarm list synchronisation neither effect the contents from the A.I.M.O.S. SNMP
        Agent's nor from other SNMP Manager's alarm lists except of the affected SNMP
        Manager's notification ID.

    aimosUnitManagement OBJECT-IDENTITY
      STATUS current
      DESCRIPTION 
        "This area comprises all objects dealing with unit management. This introduction
        provides an explanation of its basic structures.
        
        For each unit type there is one general table and one table per hardware version.
        E.g. there is the aimosRemoteUnitTable with objects that are valid for each
        Remote Unit, and the aimosRemoteUnitV1Table with objects of the Remote Unit
        Version 1. The general table contains one OID referring to the unit-specific
        table.
        
        Unit Reference
        ==============
        
        The Index of the general tables is composed of the topological arrangement of
        the units, i.e. depending on the arrangement it might contain several objects.
        The Index of a general Remote Unit table entry (aimosRemoteUnitTable) is e.g.
        composed of the Index of the Master Unit (aimosMasterID of type MasterID), the
        Index of the SubRack Master Unit (aimosSubRackID of type SubRackID) and the
        Index of the Remote Unit itself (aimosRemoteID of type RemoteID), since they
        are arranged in this order, whereas the Master Unit itself only has one Index
        (aimosMasterID), because there are no higher level units.
        
        All unit-specific tables, however, are always identified by two objects, one of
        the UnitReference type and the other of type ValueSource. Here, it does not
        matter whether it is a Master Unit or a Remote Unit.
        
        Value Source
        ============
        
        The unit-specific tables have three entries per unit:
         one entry specifies the desired values
         one entry serves to read the current values and to buffer them for subsequent
          access
         and the third entry contains the buffered values
        
        Which one of these three entries is to be accessed is specified with the second
        Index of the unit-specific tables of type ValueSource.
        
        To avoid that a GET BULK results in endless hardware accesses, the A.I.M.O.S. SNMP
        Agent normally provides only the buffered values. Also, in case of a GET NEXT
        only the table entry corresponding to ValueSource cachedValue(2) is returned.
        
        Read accesses with cachedValue(2), however, are treated like accesses with
        actualValue(1), if no buffered values are available or if the time stamp
        belonging to these values was deleted.
        
        ValueSource desiredValue(3) is to be used for write access. However, the
        A.I.M.O.S. SNMP Agent also accepts write access to table entries with ValueSource
        cachedValue(2). This is treated as if the write access was made with
        desiredValue(3).
        
        Values
        ======
        
        The unit specific tables comprise objects containing various types of status
        information. Due to performance reasons, values of the same 'topic' are put
        together on a logic basis. Such logical object groups can be recognised by the
        name. E.g. the aimosSubRackV1Table comprises the following objects regarding
        attenuation:
         aimosSubRackV1AttenuationAge
         aimosSubRackV1AttenuationAmp1DL
         aimosSubRackV1AttenuationAmp1UL
         aimosSubRackV1AttenuationAmp2DL
         aimosSubRackV1AttenuationAmp2UL
         aimosSubRackV1AttenuationAmp3DL
         aimosSubRackV1AttenuationAmp3UL
        
        These values are always dealt with together, i.e. if one of these values is to
        be read directly by the Master Controller, all the other values will be read,
        too. The time of this access is recorded in the age-object belonging to each
        status group.
        
        Time objects can be set to 0. This serves to prompt the A.I.M.O.S. SNMP Agent
        to get the current values with the next access to a cachedValue(2)-instance."

        During this process aimosMasterState has the value performNetInfoRequest(5).
        
        After the query the value changes to properlySet(7). Moreover, the tables
        aimosSubRackTable, aimosRemoteUnitTable, aimosGSMNSOTable and aimosUMTSNSOTable
        have one entry for each of the network elements found. Each of these tables
        (like the aimosMasterUnitTable) have one object referring to the hardware version
        specific tables (aimosMasterOID, aimosSubRackOID, aimosRemoteOID, etc.). These,
        too, have one entry for each of the network elements found after a successful
        query.
        
        It is possible that one of the queries mentioned before fails:
        
         If the GUID query was not successful the value of aimosMasterState changes
          from performGUIDRequest(2) to missingGUID(3). For this, there may be various
          reasons:
           One might be that the Master Controller cannot be reached under the IP
            address and Port Number given by aimosMasterAddress. In such a case, the
            A.I.M.O.S. SNMP Agent answers the allocation to aimosMasterAddress with SNMP
            ErrorStatus resourceUnavailable(13). The error will be corrected by
            correcting the IP address and/or Port in aimosMasterAddress.
        
           Another reason may be that the User in aimosMasterLoginUserName or the
            password in aimosMasterLoginPassword are wrong. Then, the A.I.M.O.S. SNMP
            Agent returns SNMP ErrorStatus noAccess(6). The error is corrected by
            assigning the correct Username to aimosMasterLoginUserName and/or the correct
            password to aimosMasterLoginPassword. Such an error may be prevented in
            advance by adjusting the pre-settings of these two objects. This can be done
            via the two objects aimosInitiallyMasterLoginUserName and
            aimosInitiallyMasterLoginPassword. Afterwards, a new GUID query must be made
            by setting aimosMasterState to requestGUID(1).
        
           It is also possible that the Master Controller is not ready. This error can
            be corrected by starting the Master Controller or by making it available in
            the network (Firewall ?). Afterwards, a new GUID query must be made by
            setting aimosMasterState to requestGUID(1).
        
         When a query of the network structure and/or status information failed, the
          value of aimosMasterState changes from performNetInfoRequest(5) to
          missingNetInfo(6). After correcting the cause of the failure another try to
          query the network structure must be made by setting aimosMasterState to
          requestNetInfo(4).
        
        These steps must be repeated until aimosMasterState is set to properlySet(7).
        Sometimes it might help to delete Master Controller and create it anew.
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        This Leaf indicates, if the master unit is properly configured.
        
        If the GUID is missing, this Leaf contains missingGUID(3).
        You can assign requestGUID(1) to aimosMasterState, in order to
        inquire the GUID at the CONTROLLER. During the inquiry
        aimosMasterState's value changes to performGUIDRequest(2).
        If the inquiry is done, the value changes to
        - missingGUID(3) if the request was not successful
          (that means, the GUID is still unknown)
        - missingNetInfo(6) if the master controllers network is unknown
        - missingCommParams(8) if aimosMasterCommunicationID is not set
        - properlySet(9) if the master controllers
          - GUID (aimosMasterGUID) is knownn
          - network is known
          - Communication ID (aimosMasterCommunicationID) is set
        
        If the master controllers network is unknown (missingNetInfo(6)),
        set aimosMasterState to requestNetInfo(4). Until this command
        is recognized by the master controller aimosMasterState is
        performNetInfoRequest(5).
        
        If the CommunicationID is unknown (missingCommParams(8)), set
        aimosMasterCommunicationID to an appropriate value. Until this
        command is recognized by the master controller aimosMasterState
        is performSetCommParams(7).
        
        Each master controller should have the value properlySet(9) here.
        
        Changes, which are made here, affect all organizations. That's why TelCo's are not
        allowed to make any changes here."

         aimosAlarmListCustomerRemoteInfo  custom name for the affected Remote Unit
        
        aimosAlarmCleared notifications have afterwards the following object:
         aimosAlarmListClearReason         the reason why alarm has gone
        
        All alarms end with the following objects:
         aimosAcknowledgementOID acknowledgement OID value
         snmpTrapEnterprise      enterprise OID value
                                  (note: if aimosPhoneBookInterfaceType is set to
                                  ifAimosObsolete(4) aimosTrapEnterprise is used instead)
        
        If aimosPhoneBookInterfaceType is on its default value ifMIBDefault(0), then each
        of the object mentioned before has an appropriate instance identifier. That is,
        aimosOrgID has the OrgID itself as instance identifier and, for example,
        aimosAlarmListID has aimosOrgID and aimosAlarmListID as instance identifier,
        since these objects are defined in that manner.
        
        If aimosPhoneBookInterfaceType is set to ifAimosObsolete(4), then each object in
        the alarm notification has an instance identifier of zero. The only exception
        from this rule is aimosTrapOID. This object has no instance identifier.
        
        After having emitted an alarm notification with the objects mentioned before
        included, the A.I.M.O.S. SNMP Agent expects an acknowledgement within a certain
        period of time. This interval can be specified in aimosAlarmAckExpectInterval.
        
        Each SNMP Manager must confirm the receipt of the notification unless its
        inability of acknowledgements is indicated by appropriate settings made to
        aimosPhoneBookAckCapability.
        The acknowledgement will be done by setting aimosAlarmTrapAcknowledgementState
        to acknowledged(2). This OID is indexed by aimosOrgID, aimosAlarmTrapID and
        aimosAlarmListID. The notification makes the OID required for acknowledgement
        (object including instance identifiers) available in the aimosAcknowledgementOID.
        
        If a set request is made to aimosAlarmTrapAcknowledgementState, additionally
        aimosAlarmTrapAcknowledgementUser is set to the current user and
        aimosAlarmTrapAcknowledgementTime is set to the time of the acknowledgement.
        
        If an expected acknowledgement is missed by the A.I.M.O.S. SNMP Agent it will send
        the alarm repeatedly again until the alarm is acknowledged by the affected SNMP
        Manager. The objects contents of a re-sending alarm notification are identical
        to the preceding ones, especially the counter values (aimosAlarmTrapID,
        aimosAlarmTrapNotificationID, aimosAlarmListID, aimosAlarmListAlarmEventID).
        
        Each SNMP Manager may examine the incoming alarms notification ID. If it is not
        incremented by one since the last notification, it is an indication for missing
        notifications. The SNMP manager should wait a while until the SnMP Agent has
        resend the missing notification(s) unless acknowledgement is deactivated
        (aimosPhoneBookAckCapability is false(0)). In the latter case the SNMP Manager
        should synchronize its alarm table with the SNMP Agent ones by setting
        aimosPhoneBookAlarmListResync to start(5)."

      DESCRIPTION 
        "A aimosAgentAnnouncement notification is emitted by the agent if it is put in or
        out of operation. aimosAgentState of type AgentState indicates what actually
        happens. aimosAgentAnnouncement notification has no aimosAlarmCleared

        Cold Start
        ==========
        A aimosAgentState of snmpColdStart(1) indicates, that the agent has been started.
        Already existing Sessions are invalid; requests will be responded by
        authorisation errors.
        
        The relevant alarm list entry contains aimosAlarmListAlarmID set to alarmOMC(62)
        and aimosAlarmListSpecificProblem set to 8880.
        
        Pause
        =====
        A aimosAgentState of snmpPause(2) signifies that the A.I.M.O.S. SNMP Agent is
        proceed to pause its activity. Even though the A.I.M.O.S. SNMP Agent's process
        will remain active, requests will result in time outs until aimosAgentAnnouncement
        with aimosAgentState set to snmpResume(3) is forwarded.
        
        The relevant alarm list entry contains aimosAlarmListAlarmID set to alarmOMC(62)
        and aimosAlarmListSpecificProblem set to 8887.
        
        The agent is waiting a certain period of time for acknowledgements before going
        in pause mode. If the agent comes back in operation, it will recognise missing
        acknowledgements and continue sending out aimosAgentAnnouncement notifications
        regarding the AgentState of snmpPause(2) additional to the aimosAgentAnnouncement
        notifications regarding the AgentState of snmpResume(3). This may prevent the
        manager from requesting a synchronisation of the alarm list due to the gap in the
        sequence of notification ID's.
        
        Resume
        ======
        A aimosAgentState of snmpResume(3) signifies that the A.I.M.O.S. SNMP Agent is
        resuming its activity. Already existing Sessions remain valid, except they were
        not used for a period longer than the one specified in aimosSessionTimeout.
        
        The relevant alarm list entry contains aimosAlarmListAlarmID set to alarmOMC(62)
        and aimosAlarmListSpecificProblem set to 8881.
        
        Shut Down
        =========
        A aimosAgentState of snmpShutDown(4) signifies that the A.I.M.O.S. SNMP Agent is
        about to shut down. The A.I.M.O.S. SNMP Agent waits a certain time for the SNMP
        Managers to be able to acknowledge this notification before actually shutting down.
        
        If the process terminates, all Sessions are invalidated. The agent doesn't
        respond to requests until aimosAgentAnnouncement with aimosAgentState set to
        snmpColdStart(1) is forwarded.
        
        The relevant alarm list entry contains aimosAlarmListAlarmID set to alarmOMC(62)
        and aimosAlarmListSpecificProblem set to 8889.
        
        If the A.I.M.O.S. SNMP Agent comes back in operation, it will recognise missing
        acknowledgements and continue sending out aimosAgentAnnouncement notifications
        regarding the AgentState of snmpShutDown(4) additional to the
        aimosAgentAnnouncement notifications regarding the AgentState of
        snmpColdStart(1). This may prevent the manager from requesting a synchronisation
        of the alarm list due to the gapin the sequence of notification ID's."

        aimosAlarmListEventTime contains the time when the alarm condition is cleared.
        
        The aimosAlarmCleared notification causes the A.I.M.O.S. SNMP Agent to
         create a new alarm trap list entry containing the values of the notification
          objects,
         but not to create a new alarm list entry.
        
        Instead, the agent makes some amendments to the alarm list. Its entries created
        for the aimosAlarmNew and if applicable aimosAlarmChanged notifications
        (correlated with the aimosAlarmCleared notification by identical values in
        aimosAlarmListAlarmEventID) are modified in the following manner:

         the notifications value of aimosAlarmListEventTime is assigned to the alarm
