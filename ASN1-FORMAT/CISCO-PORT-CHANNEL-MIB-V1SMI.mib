portChannelTable OBJECT-TYPE
    SYNTAX SEQUENCE OF PortChannelEntry
    ACCESS not-accessible
    STATUS mandatory
    DESCRIPTION
        "This table facilitates the creation and deletion of a 
         Port Channel interface to achieve higher bandwidths 
         than just one E_port. More than one E_port can be a  
         member of an Port Channel port. 
         NOTE:Only E_ports can be members of an Port Channel 
         port. 
          
         A port is added to a Port Channel port by setting  
         portChannelMemberList,and the 'manner' in which the  
         agent performs the type of addition is determined  
         by the value of portChannelAddType. 
          
         During the period when port(s) is being added to the 
         Port Channel, the agent will not allow to change any  
         parameters of the port(s) being added. Also if the  
         operation is successful (i.e. port(s) is added to the  
         Port Channel) then also the agent will not allow to  
         change any parameters of the individual port(s) that is 
         added. But any change done to the Port Channel port 
         will also be applied to the port(s) which are member(s) 
         of this Port channel port. Once a port(s) is removed 
         from a Port Channel Port it will retain the values that 
         it had when it was a member of the Port Channel port. 
         It will not have the old values it had before joining 
         the Port Channel port.  
        
         The port(s) that are added/removed to/from a  
         Port Channel port will be put into administratively 
         down (ifAdminStatus='down') which results into 
         operationally down(ifOperStatus='down'). To bring the  
         port up again, the user has to set the port to be 
         administratively up(ifAdminStatus='up'). Then the port 
         goes through its initialization cycle to become  
         active(ifOperStatus='up'). "
