Introduction:

Notifications on ESXi are composed from IETF standard
and VMWARE enterprise MIB module documents and 3rd party CIM providers.

The MIB modules are compatible back to ESX 2.0, always load the latest set to 
manage all vesions of ESXi and ESX Classic.

Here is a summary of the MIB modules that define notifications which are sent on the wire 
as SNMPv1 Trap Protocol data units (PDUs) for the first two sources of
notifications. See 3rd party plugin documentation for their on SNMP notifications. 
Example output is also provided.

Configurating notifications with RCLI command:

Two new options were added to vicfg-snmp command line.
First one provides a backward compatibility switch for VMWARE-ENV-MIB for ESX
releases prior to 5.0 use the cmd:
  vicfg-snmp --hwsrc sensors  # switch to pre-ESXi 5.0 notifcation format
Second, one can now filter out/stop sending notifications. Just provide the
oid in the form enterprise.0.trapid
  vicfg-snmp --notraps 1.3.6.1.4.1.6876.1.0.302,1.3.6.1.4.1.6876.1.0.303
 
ESXi NOTIFICATIONS:

SNMPv2-MIB (http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3418.txt)
  coldStart  -- sent when esx reboots 
  warmStart  -- sent when vmware-hostd process restarts

IF-MIB (http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2863.txt)
  linkDown  -- Physical interface changed to down state
  linkUp  -- Physical interface changed to down state
   When one receives these notifications, they will contain the ifIndex which
   when used to poll the ifTable shall see the following
   managed objects change state: ifLastChange, ifSpeed, ifOperStatus change state)

VMWARE-VMINFO-MIB 
 vmPoweredOn TRAP-TYPE 
   VARIABLES { vmID, vmConfigFile, vmDisplayName }
   DESCRIPTION 
    "This trap is sent when a virtual machine is powered on from a suspended 
     or a powered off state. The origin of this event can be several:
     for instance may be operator initiated, existing vmx process reconnects to control subsystem. 
     NOTE: vms powered up due to VMotion are not reported. Upon receiving this notification client applications should
     poll the vmwVmTable to obtain current status."
   ::= 1 

vmPoweredOff TRAP-TYPE 
   VARIABLES { vmID, vmConfigFile, vmDisplayName }
   DESCRIPTION 
    "This trap is sent when a virtual machine is powered off. The origin of this event can be several:
     for instance may be operator initiated, vmx process terminating abnormally. NOTE: vms powered down due
     to VMotion are not reported. Upon receiving this notification client applications should
     poll the vmwVmTable to obtain current status."
   ::= 2 

vmHBLost TRAP-TYPE 
   VARIABLES { vmID, vmConfigFile, vmDisplayName }
   DESCRIPTION 
    "This trap is sent when a virtual machine detects a loss in guest heartbeat. The Guest heartbeat
     is only sent if VMware Tools are installed in the Guest OS. Control process will send this event whenever it 
     determines the number of guest heartbeats for a given period of time have not been received. 
     Upon receiving this notification client applications should
     poll the vmwVmTable to obtain current status."
   ::= 3 

vmHBDetected TRAP-TYPE 
   VARIABLES { vmID, vmConfigFile, vmDisplayName }
   DESCRIPTION 
    "This trap is sent when a virtual machine detects or regains the required number of guest heartbeats
     for a given period of time. This is only sent if VMware tools are installed in the Guest OS.
     Upon receiving this notification client applications should
     poll the vmwVmTable to obtain current status."
   ::= 4 

vmSuspended TRAP-TYPE 
   VARIABLES { vmID, vmConfigFile, vmDisplayName }
   DESCRIPTION 
    "This trap is sent when a virtual machine is suspended. The origin of this event may be several: operator
     initiated, by software api clients, and by other means.
     Upon receiving this notification client applications should
     poll the vmwVmTable to obtain current status."

VMWARE-ENV-MIB
   Starting with ESXi 5.0, VMware enterprise hardware related notifcations are reported in the specific identifier field of SNMPv1 trap PDU: 
VMWARE-ENV-MIB vmwEnvHardwareEvent            notification 1.3.6.1.4.1.6876.0.301
VMWARE-ENV-MIB vmwESXEnvHardwareEvent         notification 1.3.6.1.4.1.6876.4.1.0.301

Environmental/hardware related notifications in VMWARE-ENV-MIB are the same content as found in ESXi CIM Indications.

Prior to ESXi 5.0, this is the trap one would get: 
  vmwEnvHardwareEvent TRAP-TYPE 
      VARIABLES { vmwSubsystemType, vmwHardwareStatus, vmwEventDescription, vmwEnvHardwareTime }
      DESCRIPTION 
          "This notification, if the agent is so configured, may be sent when 
           the ESX Operating System has detected a material change in 
           physical condition of the hardware" 
      ::= 301 

    This generic notification depends on the CIM subsystem mappings to discrete IPMI sensors.
    For example on a Dell R805, one might see one or more alarms as follows: 
    2007-11-01 16:15:42 esx014.eng.vmware.com [10.17.21.14] (via 10.17.21.14) TRAP, SNMP v1, community private
	SNMPv2-SMI::VMWARE-PRODUCTS-MIB::vmwESX Enterprise Specific Trap (301) Uptime: 0:00:06.76
	VMWARE-ENV-MIB::vmwSubsystemType.1 = INTEGER: unknown(1)	
        VMWARE-ENV-MIB::vmwHardwareStatus.1 = INTEGER: critical(4)	
        VMWARE-ENV-MIB::vmwEventDescription.1 = STRING: "USB Over-current 65 for BIOS 1"	
        VMWARE-ENV-MIB::vmwEnvHardwareTime.1 = Timeticks: (675) 0:00:06.75

        External RAID enclosure configured to RAID 5, pull cable from one of the disk and this is sent:

        2007-11-14 10:11:15 scho1-dev.eng.vmware.com [10.20.110.134] (via 10.20.110.134) TRAP, SNMP v1, community private
        VMWARE-PRODUCTS-MIB::vmwESX Enterprise Specific Trap (301) Uptime: 0:03:11.14
        VMWARE-ENV-MIB::vmwSubsystemType.1 = INTEGER: raidController(9) 
        VMWARE-ENV-MIB::vmwHardwareStatus.1 = INTEGER: marginal(3)      
        VMWARE-ENV-MIB::vmwERING: "RAID1 Virtual Disk 0 of Controller 0"    
        VMWARE-ENV-MIB::vmwEnvHardwareTime.1 = Timeticks: (19114) 0:03:11.14

        NOTE: Given the specific hardware above for example
         one would next consult the Dell R805 Dell's documentation 
         on IPMI messages for the majority of those listed (not all):
         http://support.dell.com/support/edocs/software/svradmin/5.5/en/MSG/html/msgch30.htm

EXAMPLES:

2007-11-01 16:14:11 NET-SNMP version 5.1.2 Started.
# hostd is rebooted while esx is up, a warmStart trap is sent...

2007-11-01 16:14:36 esx014.eng.vmware.com [10.17.21.14] (via 10.17.21.14) TRAP, SNMP v1, community private
	SNMPv2-SMI::VMWARE-PRODUCTS-MIB::vmwESX Warm Start Trap (0) Uptime: 0:00:00.02


vSPHERE Center Server Notifications

VMWARE-VC-EVENT-MIB:

vmwVCNotifications OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= {vmwVC 0}
vpxdAlarm NOTIFICATION-TYPE
    OBJECTS { vmwVpxdTrapType, vmwVpxdHostName, vmwVpxdVMName, 
              vmwVpxdOldStatus, vmwVpxdNewStatus, vmwVpxdObjValue }
    STATUS      current 
    DESCRIPTION 
        "This trap is sent when entity alarm status changed."
    ::= { vmwVCNotifications 201 }
        
vpxdDiagnostic NOTIFICATION-TYPE
    STATUS      current
    DESCRIPTION
        "This trap is sent on starting or restarting vCenter Server, 
         on requesting a test notification explicitly, and can also be 
         configured to be sent periodically at a specified time interval via 
         vCenter Server configuration."
    ::= { vmwVCNotifications 202 }

The vpxdAlarm notification is transmitted from vCenter Server on changes in
alarm state, dictated by the trigger and notification configuration of the
alarm.

The vpxdDiagnostic notification is used for generating test traps as well as
generating coldStart traps for vCenter Server starts/restarts.
The transmission of test traps can be configured through the vCenter Server
OptionManager interface, or through the vCenter configuration file (vpxd.cfg),
using the following keys:
snmp.testTrap.periodic.enable ("true"/"false")
snmp.testTrap.periodic.period (defaults to 300) (Number of milliseconds)
snmp.coldStartTrap.enable (defaults to "true") ("true"/"false")
