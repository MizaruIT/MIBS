-- cnMpoaIpVerification Group
--
-- This group is implemented to provide security features that are
-- inherently lacking in the MPOA specification.  The security
-- is provided using a table of IP addresses that limits the 
-- IP addresses serviced by the MPOA Client (MPC).  The table is
-- either an inclusion or exclusion list that allows or dissallows
-- MPOA shortcuts for the identified range of addresses.
