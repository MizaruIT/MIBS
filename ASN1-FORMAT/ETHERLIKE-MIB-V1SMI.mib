--    The Time-Domain Reflectometry (TDR) test is
--    specific to ethernet-like interfaces of type
--    10Base5 and 10Base2.  The TDR value may be
--    useful in determining the approximate distance
--    to a cable fault.  It is advisable to repeat
--    this test to check for a consistent resulting
--    TDR value, to verify that there is a fault.
--    
--    A TDR test returns as its result the time
--    interval, measured in 10 MHz ticks or 100 nsec
--    units, between the start of TDR test
--    transmission and the subsequent detection of a
--    collision or deassertion of carrier.  On
--    successful completion of a TDR test, the result
--    is stored as the value of an appropriate
--    instance of an appropriate vendor specific MIB
--    object, and the OBJECT IDENTIFIER of that
--    instance is stored in the appropriate instance
--    of the appropriate test result code object
--    (thereby indicating where the result has been
--    stored).

--    This test configures the MAC chip and executes

--    only be executed if the interface is offline.
--    Once the test has completed, the MAC chip should
--    be reinitialized for network operation, but it
--    should remain offline.
--    
--    If an error occurs during a test, the
--    appropriate test result object will be set
--    to indicate a failure.  The two OBJECT
--    IDENTIFIER values dot3ErrorInitError and

        This object contains an OBJECT IDENTIFIER

        several different chips. The MIB implementor

        should identify the chip which is usually
        called the Medium Access Control chip.
        If no such chip is easily identifiable,
        the implementor should identify the chip
        which actually gathers the transmit
        and receive statistics and error
        indications. This would allow a
        manager station to correlate the
        statistics and the chip generating

        "The current mode of operation of the MAC

        duplex mode could not be determined.
        
        Management control of the duplex mode is
        accomplished through the MAU MIB.  When
        an interface does not support autonegotiation,
        or when autonegotiation is not enabled, the
        duplex mode is controlled using
        ifMauDefaultType.  When autonegotiation is
        supported and enabled, duplex mode is controlled
        using ifMauAutoNegAdvertisedBits.  In either
        case, the currently operating duplex mode is
        reflected both in this object and in ifMauType.
        
        Note that this object provides redundant
        information with ifMauType.  Normally, redundant
        objects are discouraged.  However, in this
        instance, it allows a management application to
        determine the duplex status of an interface
        without having to know every possible value of
        ifMauType.  This was felt to be sufficiently
        valuable to justify the redundancy."
