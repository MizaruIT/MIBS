    DESCRIPTION
      "The license for the system is about to

jnxWxGrpEventInFailSafeMode NOTIFICATION-TYPE
    STATUS  current
    DESCRIPTION
      "This trap is sent when the device boots up in fail-safe mode.
      This can happen for one of the following reasons:
      Fail-safe reboot was explicitly initiated by the user.
      The device rebooted automatically too many times because of
      the failure of internal consistency checks or the failure of
      tests that verify proper operation of the device."

    DESCRIPTION
      "A mismatch is detected between the local and remote

    DESCRIPTION
      "A possible mismatch was detected between the duplex settings
      of either the local or remote interface and that of the
      device attached to that interface. The interface (local
      or remote) is identified by the 'ifIndex' object.

      Note that this notification is quite different from
      jnxWxGrpEventInterfaceSpeedMismatch, which compares the
      local and remote interfaces on the same WX device."
