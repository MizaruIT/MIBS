--  Descr
--    This MIB module is for configuration of the MAC notification
--    feature. MAC notification is a mechanism to inform monitoring
--    devices when there are MAC addresses learnt or removed from
--    the forwarding database of the monitored devices.

    DESCRIPTION
        "Indicates whether the MAC notification feature is currently 
        running in the device.
        
        Setting this object to false(2) disables the MAC notification
        feature globally thus disabling the feature at each interface.
        
        Setting this object to true(1) will start the MAC notification
        feature running in the device. If the feature is already
        running, setting to true(1) has no effect. Once the MAC
        notification is enabled, whether the feature is running at each
        interface is controlled by the cmnIfConfigTable."

        "This object specifies the maximum interval of time between

        If the value of cmnNotificationsEnabled is true(1), the
        device will send out the generated cmnMacChangedNotifications
        and archive the MAC change notification events in the
        cmnHistoryTable. If the value of cmnNotificationEnabled is
        false(2), the device will not send out the generated
        cmnMacChangedNotifications but it will archive these events
        in the cmnHistoryTable.   
        
        If the value of this object is equal to 0, the device will 
        generate cmnMacChangedNotifications and archive the MAC 
        change notification events in the cmnHistoryTable as soon as
        there is MAC address learnt or removed by the device.
        
        If the value of this object is greater than 0, the device will
        wait for a period of time equal to the value of this object
        before generate the cmnMacChangedNotifications and archive
        the MAC change notification events in the cmnHistoryTable."
