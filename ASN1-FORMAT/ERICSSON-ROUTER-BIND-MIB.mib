		it can be bound.  See the definition of the EriRouterCircuitHandle
		TEXTUAL-CONVENTION for the definition of this key."

eriRouterBindType OBJECT-TYPE
	SYNTAX       EriRouterBindType
	MAX-ACCESS   read-create
	STATUS       current
	DESCRIPTION
		"The type of the binding.  See the definition of the
		EriRouterBindType TEXTUAL-CONVENTION for the possible types.

		The bind type must be appropriate to the type of circuit
		that it is being applied to.  See the AOS Command Reference
		Manual for a complete exposition of what circuit types may be
		associated with which bindings.

		Note that when a circuit is created, an initial binding is
		established of type 'unbound'.  So there is always some
		binding in effect for a circuit; there is no concept of
		explicitly creating or deleting a binding, there is merely
		setting it's type and supplying the applicable attributes
		for the bind type.

		In other words, with respect to entries in this table,
		when a circuit is created, a row in this table is also
		created. and when a circuit is deleted, the row in this
		table is also deleted.

		If you change the bind type to a new bind type for a
		circuit, the previous binding is removed and any active
		sessions are dropped.  If an existing binding on the circuit
		is exactly the same as specified in the new binding, the
		existing binding is not removed.  When changing the bind
		type to a new bind type, all objects mandatory for the
		new bind type must be included in the set operation.

		Thus, the bind type will determine which group of objects
		in a row of the eriRouterBindTable that will be applicable
		for that instance of a circuit.

		For example, if the bind type is 'subscriberBind', then
		the columns in the row that are applicable will be:

                eriRouterBindType
                eriRouterBindName
                eriRouterBindContext
                eriRouterBindPassword

		In a set operation, if additional columns are specified for
		some given bind type, that is, columnar objects which are not
		applicable to the given bind type, an INCONSISTENT VALUE
		error will be returned.

		The DESCRIPTION clause for each of the eriRouterBindTable objects
		specifies the bind types that are applicable for that object.

		For a complete specification of the various bind types
		and the applicable columns of the eriRouterBindTable, please
		see AOS Command Reference manual."
