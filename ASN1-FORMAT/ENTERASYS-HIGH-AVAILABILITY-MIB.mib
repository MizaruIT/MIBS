        "This object is a user-assigned value used to assign individual
         modules to a High-Availability Upgrade Group.  All slots
         within an upgrade group will be upgraded simultaneously.

         The purpose of assigning multiple slots to the same upgrade
         group is to reduce the overall time it takes to perform an
         HA upgrade.
         
         By default, each module is assigned to its own upgrade
         group, with GroupId equal to the module's HAU Slot.  Although
         this default configuration is completely valid, it may not
         be optimal for situations where a timely HA upgrade is
         desirable.
         
         The network architecture, specifically LAGs, must be taken
         into consideration when assigning slots to an upgrade group.
         LAGs which span multiple modules should not have all of their
         modules placed into the same upgrade group, as this would
         defeat the LAG's inherent redundancy.
         
         IMPORTANT:
         If a LAG is to remain available during a High-Availability
         Upgrade, then it must comprised of multiple single-port links
         which reside on separate modules.  Furthermore, at least two
         of those modules must reside in separate upgrade groups."
