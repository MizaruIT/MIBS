-- Open issues:

--   o Do we need an Isolated parameter for a class? (see definition
--   of "isolated" in Floyd/Jacobson paper).

--   o Do we need the xtmUnsatisfied NOTIFICATION-TYPE (and associated
--   on/off configuration attribute?)

--   o What are the ranges, units and default values for MaxIdle,
--   OffTime, and MinIdle?

--   o Should we have a Counter64 version of xtmClassOutOctets?

--   o Are there any other class parameters that can't be modified
--   once the class is in use? (See the DESCRIPTION of xtmClassEntry.)

        For example, '1,12,55'.  Contiguous and discontiguous ranges
        may be combined, as in '1,5-10,12,55'.

        When set, values are added to the existing XtmRange.  For 
        example, setting '100-200' to the existing range of '1,5-10,12,55'
        yields the value '1,5-10,12,55,100-200'.

        Values may be deleted from a list using the minus (-) symbol.
        For example, setting range consisting of '1,5-10,12,55,100-200'
        to '-55,-150' yields the range string '1,5-10,12,100-149,151-200'.
        String values may be completely deleted by setting them to the

    STATUS      current
    DESCRIPTION
        "This table is a 'flattened' version of a hierarchical class
        trees that specify the bandwidth allocation for the CBQ
        interfaces of the system.

        Each tree is rooted at an interface. A class may either be a
        leaf, meaning it has no children, or it may be an interior
        class which has children. As packets are forwarded out an
        interface, they are compared to the 'flow definition' of each
        class down the tree until a matching leaf is found or until
        all classes are traversed. Once a matching class is found, the
        packet is transmitted or not based on the constraints
        configured for the class, most importantly the allocated
        bandwidth as identified by xtmClassRate. If no matching class
        is found, the packet is dropped.

        The 'flow definition' for a class can be defined based on
        inclusive ranges of the following packet fields:
            o Source IP Address (or a domain name)
            o Destination IP Address (or a domain name)
            o Protocol above layer 3 (e.g., UDP, TCP, ICMP, etc.)
            o Source Port (which identifies service, e.g., FTP,
              Telnet, SMTP, etc.)
            o Destination Port

        It is important that packets only match zero or one traffic
        class. In order for this to be true, certain rules must be
        enforced when classes are defined. Specifically, all 'sibling'
        classes must be defined using the same criteria. Also,
        children must use criteria not already specified by one of
        their ancestors or they must specify a subrange of an already
        specified criteria. Therefore, this tree would be legal:

        interface 1
            subnet A
                protocol UDP
                    port SNMP
                protocol TCP
            subnet B

        But this tree would be illegal:

        interface 2
            subnet A
                subnet B (illegal -- not subrange of parent)
            protocol TCP (illegal -- different criteria than sibling)"
