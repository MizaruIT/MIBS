    DESCRIPTION 
        "The ingress port list for this ACE. It is active only when the hit
         action is denied. Set the action value to 1(deny) before the new
         setting. Set value 0 to disable the opertion. Each octet within this
         value specifies a set of eight ports, with the first octet specifying
         ports 1 through 8, the second octet specifying ports 9 through 16, etc.
         Within each octet, the most significant bit represents the lowest
         numbered port, and the least significant bit represents the highest
         numbered port. Thus, each port of the switch is represented by a single
         bit within the value of this object. If that bit has a value of '1'
         then that port is included in the set of ports; the port is not
         included if its bit has a value of '0'."
