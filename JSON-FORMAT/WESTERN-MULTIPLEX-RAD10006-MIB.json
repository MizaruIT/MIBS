    "description": "This persistent variable controls whether the Agent will attempt to send the 'txSynthTrap' trap whenever the Radio has a transition of its tansmitter-synthesizer alarm condition. The 'TxSynthTrap' trap is defined in this MIB definition file. 'no-trap' indicates that the NMU, should not generate any SNMP trap on any transition. This is the default value. 'send-trap-on-alarm-transition' indicates that the NMU will only generate a SNMP trap on the transition to the 'alarm' state. 'send-trap-on-normal-transition' indicates that the NMU will only generate a SNMP trap on the transition to the 'normal' state. 'send-trap-on-both-transitions' indicates that the NMU will generate a SNMP trap on any transition. Whenever the SNMP Agent attempts to send the 'TxSynthTrap' trap, other checks described below may prohibit this trap from transmission. Whenever this variable prohibits a trap from being sent, then 'trapFilteredSpecific' will be incremented. This MIB variable is the first of four checks that the NMU Agent uses to filter traps, based upon 1) a specific enable or disable control variable; 2) 'trapControl' which offers a gross on/off/limit control; 3) 'trapMgrTable' with 'trapMgrControl' and 'trapMgrAddress' which filters whether enterprise traps (such as this trap) and/or standard (RFC 1215) traps are sent to each specific trap manager; and 4) 'trapSeverityFilter' which filters traps according to a controlling severity variable for the specific trap, which in this case is described below, and is defined as 'mgmtTxSynthSeverity'. Whenever any of these trap filters cause a trap to be filtered, the corresponding MIB statistic is incremented. These statistics are 'trapFilteredSpecific', 'trapFilteredControl', 'trapFilteredManager', and 'trapFilteredSeverity'. See the MIB descriptions (in this file, and in 'westmux.mib' file) for any of these above variables for details."
