Its purpose is to allow a management application (primarily an accounting application) that is monitoring the ISR counts to receive the final values of these counts, so that the application can properly account for the amounts the counts were incremented since the last time the application polled them. The appnIsInSessUpTime object provides the total amount of time that the session was active. This notification is not a substitute for polling the ISR counts. In particular, the count values reported in this notification cannot be assumed to be the complete totals for the life of the session, since they may have wrapped while the session was up. The session to which the objects in this notification apply is identified by the fully qualified CP name and PCID that make up the table index. An instance of this notification will contain exactly one instance of each of its objects, and these objects will all belong to the same conceptual row of the appnIsInTable. Generation of this notification is controlled by the same object in the APPN MIB, appnIsInGlobeCtrAdminStatus, that controls whether the count objects themselves are being incremented."
