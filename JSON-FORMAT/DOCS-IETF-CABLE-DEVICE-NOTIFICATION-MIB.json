    "description": "The Event Notification MIB is an extension of the CABLE DEVICE MIB. It defines various notification objects for both cable modem and cable modem termination systems. Two groups of SNMP notification objects are defined. One group is for notifying cable modem events, and one group is for notifying cable modem termination system events. DOCSIS defines numerous events, and each event is assigned to a functional category. This MIB defines a notification object for each functional category. The varbinding list of each notification includes information about the event that occurred on the device. Copyright (C) The Internet Society (2006). This version of this MIB module is part of RFC 4547; see the RFC itself for full legal notices."
