It is suggested that the TransportAddressType or TransportDomain is logically registered before the object(s) which use the TransportAddress textual convention if they appear in the same logical row. The value of a TransportAddress object must always be consistent with the value of the associated TransportAddressType or TransportDomain object. Attempts to set a TransportAddress object to a value which is inconsistent with the associated TransportAddressType or TransportDomain must fail with an inconsistentValue error.
