The corresponding transport address is of type SnmpUDPVPNAddress. A VPN is defined as a set of sites with a common community of interest. Sites within an MPLS-based VPN often have private addresses which aren't accessible from outside of the VPN, and may be duplicates of private addresses used in other VPNs. To uniquely identify such a private address, it must be associated with a particular VPN routing/forwarding instance, also known as a VRF (VPN Routing and Forwarding table).",

It also serves the purpose of distinguishing SNMP Message events from other CNS Events. device-id uniquely identifies devices subscribed to the CNS Event Service Bus. device-id may be same as the hostname for the device. The device-id must be separated from the service-field by a '.'. If the device-id is omitted, SnmpCNSIdentifier would contain just the fixed-length (19 octets) service-field. Thus target addresses are CNS Event subjects of the form: <service-field>.<device-id>"
