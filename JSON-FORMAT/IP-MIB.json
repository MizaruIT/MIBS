That is, it effectively dis-associates the interface identified with said entry from the mapping identified with said entry. It is an implementation- specific matter as to whether the agent removes an invalidated entry from the table. Accordingly, management stations must be prepared to receive tabular information from agents that corresponds to entries not currently in use. Proper interpretation of such entries requires examination of the relevant ipNetToMediaType object. As the entries in this table are typically not persistent when this object is written the entity should not save the change to non-volatile storage. Note: a stronger requirement is not used because this object was previously defined."
