Ideally the sampling entity will perform sampling on all flows originating from or destined to the specified interface. However, if the switch architecture only allows input or output sampling then the sampling agent is permitted to only sample input flows input or output flows. Each packet must only be considered once for sampling, irrespective of the number of ports it will be forwarded to. Note: Port 0 is used to indicate that all ports on the device are represented by a single data source. - sFlowFsPacketSamplingRate applies to all ports on the device capable of packet sampling. - smonVlanDataSource.<V> An SFlowDataSource of this form refers to a 'Packet-based VLAN' and is called a 'VLAN-based' dataSource. <V> is the VLAN ID as defined by the IEEE 802.1Q standard. The value is between 1 and 4094 inclusive, and it represents an 802.1Q VLAN-ID with global scope within a given bridged domain. Sampling is performed on all packets received that are part of the specified VLAN (no matter which port they arrived on). Each packet will only be considered once for sampling, irrespective of the number of ports it will be forwarded to. - entPhysicalEntry.<N> An SFlowDataSource of this form refers to a physical entity within the agent (e.g. entPhysicalClass = backplane(4)) and is called an 'entity-based' dataSource. Sampling is performed on all packets entering the resource (e.g. If the backplane is being sampled, all packets transmitted onto the backplane will be considered as single candidates for sampling irrespective of the number of ports they ultimately reach). Note: Since each SFlowDataSource operates independently a packet that crosses multiple DataSources may generate multiple flow records."

A sampling rate of 0 disables sampling. The agent is permitted to have minimum and maximum allowable values for the sampling rate. A minimum rate lets the agent designer set an upper bound on the overhead associated with sampling, and a maximum rate may be the result of hardware restrictions (such as counter size). In addition not all values between the maximum and minimum may be realizable as the sampling rate (again because of implementation considerations). When the sampling rate is set the agent is free to adjust the value so that it lies between the maximum and minimum values and has the closest achievable value. When read, the agent must return the actual sampling rate it will be using (after the adjustments previously described).

    "description": "The maximum number of seconds between successive samples of the counters associated with this data source. A sampling interval of 0 disables counter sampling. The agent is permitted to have minimum and maximum allowable values for the counter polling interval. A minimum interval lets the agent designer set an upper bound on the overhead associated with polling, and a maximum interval may be the result of implementation restrictions (such as counter size). In addition not all values between the maximum and minimum may be realizable as the sampling interval (again because of implementation considerations). When the sampling rate is set the agent is free to adjust the value so that it lies between the maximum and minimum values and has the closest achievable value. When read, the agent must return the actual sampling interval it will be using (after the adjustments previously described). The sampling algorithm must converge so that over time the number of packets sampled approaches 1/Nth of the total number of packets in the monitored flows."
