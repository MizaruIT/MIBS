An entry is created in this table by the agent for every entry in the pwTable with a pwType of 'ethernetTagged' or 'ethernet'. Additional rows may be created by the operator or the agent if multiple entries are required for the same PW. The value of pwEnetPwInstance can be arbitrarily selected to make the row unique; however, implementations that know the VLAN field value when the row is created MAY use the value of the VLAN itself for better readability and backward compatibility with older versions of this MIB module. This table provides Ethernet port mapping and VLAN configuration for each Ethernet PW. All read-create objects in this table MAY be changed at any time; however, change of some objects (for example, pwEnetVlanMode) during the PW forwarding state MAY cause traffic disruption. Manual entries in this table SHOULD be preserved after a reboot, and the agent MUST ensure the integrity of those entries. If the set of entries of a specific row is found to be inconsistent after reboot, the PW pwOperStatus MUST be declared as notPresent(5). "
