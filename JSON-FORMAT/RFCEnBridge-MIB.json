Thus, if an incoming packet matches one of the addresses in the filtering table, the packet is filtered. This is the normal operating mode of the bridge. forward(2) - all addresses in the manual filtering table are forward addresses. Thus, if an incoming packet matches one of the addresses in the filtering table, the packet is forwarded. All other addresses are filtered. "
