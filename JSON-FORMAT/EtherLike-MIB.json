This resulted in the following revisions: - Updated dot3StatsAlignmentErrors and dot3StatsSymbolErrors DESCRIPTIONs to reflect behaviour at 10 Gb/s - Added dot3StatsRateControlAbility and dot3RateControlStatus for management of the Rate Control function in 10 Gb/s WAN applications - Added 64-bit versions of all counters that are used on high-speed ethernet interfaces - Added object groups to contain the new objects - Deprecated etherStatsBaseGroup and split into etherStatsBaseGroup2 and etherStatsHalfDuplexGroup, so that interfaces which can only operate at full-duplex do not need to implement half-duplex-only statistics - Deprecated dot3Compliance and replaced it with dot3Compliance2, which includes the compliance information for the new object groups In addition, the dot3Tests and dot3Errors object identities have been deprecated, since there is no longer a standard method for using them.

This would allow a manager station to correlate the statistics and the chip generating them, giving it the ability to take into account any known anomalies in the chip.

    "description": "A count of frames for which reception on a particular interface fails due to an internal MAC sublayer receive error. A frame is only counted by an instance of this object if it is not counted by the corresponding instance of either the dot3StatsFrameTooLongs object, the dot3StatsAlignmentErrors object, or the dot3StatsFCSErrors object. The precise meaning of the count represented by an instance of this object is implementation- specific. In particular, an instance of this object may represent a count of receive errors on a particular interface that are not otherwise counted. This counter is a 64 bit version of dot3StatsInternalMacReceiveErrors. It should be used on interfaces operating at 10 Gb/s or faster. Discontinuities in the value of this counter can occur at re-initialization of the management system, and at other times as indicated by the value of ifCounterDiscontinuityTime."

It is advisable to repeat this test to check for a consistent resulting TDR value, to verify that there is a fault. A TDR test returns as its result the time interval, measured in 10 MHz ticks or 100 nsec units, between the start of TDR test transmission and the subsequent detection of a collision or deassertion of carrier. On successful completion of a TDR test, the result is stored as the value of an appropriate instance of an appropriate vendor specific MIB object, and the OBJECT IDENTIFIER of that instance is stored in the appropriate instance of the appropriate test result code object (thereby indicating where the result has been stored).
