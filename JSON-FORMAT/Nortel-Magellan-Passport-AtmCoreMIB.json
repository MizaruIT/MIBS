This attribute applies only for unshaped VCC and VPC connections. This attribute defines the transmit queueing method for all unshaped connections under this AtmIf. Per-VC queueing means that unshaped connections are treated with the same fairness as shaped queues in the transmit round-robin scheduling. The alternative to per-VC queueing is to use the common queue for a particular service category (medium or low priority). The common queue is only counted as one queue in the transmit round-robin scheduling. Thus, if there are multiple connections which are destined for the common queue, they are not fairly allocated a portion of the transmit bandwidth compared to shaped connections. When this attribute is set to perVc, any unshaped connection is allocated its own per-VC queue, and is treated with the same fairness as any shaped connections. Per-VC queues have a maximum rate of 58,962 cell/s (25 Mbit/s) in a multi-port shaping configuration. Per-VC queues also have their own congestion control level. This means that total number of cell/frame blocks allocated for several per-VC queues are higher than would be allowed on the common queue. This can be an advantage in reducing cell loss due to queue congestion. This attribute may only be set to perVc if the interface supports per-VC queueing, (specified by the perVcQueueInterfaces attribute in the AtmResourceControl component). When this attribute is set to common, any unshaped connection is destined for the common queue. The common queue has one set of congestion control levels for all cells enqueued on it. The common queue is only allocated one queue position when scheduling which queue to transmit from. Due to the possibility of unfairness, this value is only recommended in cases where the configuration cannot otherwise achieve full link utilization. When this attribute is set to autoConfigure and the interface support per-VC queueing (specified by the perVcQueueInterfaces attribute in the AtmResourceControl component) per-VC queueing is enabled for all unshaped connections. Otherwise, the common queue is used. The unshapedTransmitQueueingOper attribute indicates whether the transmit queueing is perVc or common."

    "description": "This attribute specifies the percentage of total transmit cell memory which is available for use by connections under this AtmIf. This attribute is not applicable, and is ignored for CQC-based ATM FPs. Transmit cell memory is used for storing ATM cells to be transmitted by connections under this AtmIf. It includes all cells in connections at the nrt-VBR or UBR service category. It includes cells in CBR or rt-VBR connections which are doing per-VC queueing. It does not include cells in CBR or rt-VBR connections which are allocated from the dedicated buffer for CBR common queuing or rt-VBR common queuing. If the value of this attribute is specified as 100, connections under this AtmIf may use up to 100% of the total transmit cell memory. If this attribute is specified as an amount less than 100, then only that percentage of the total transmit cell memory may be used by connections under this AtmIf. The minimum value for this attribute is 1% since some cell memory is always required for connections. For 3pDs3Atm2 and 3pE3Atm2 card types, the total cell memory displayed in Lp/x Eng Arc Aqm/0 txCellMemoryThreshold 0 is shared across all three interfaces for the card. Specifying a value of 100% enables complete overbooking of the total transmit cell memory by the three AtmIf's on this card. On a DS3 or E3 card, specifying values for this attribute such that each value is less than 100% but the sum for the three AtmIf's is more than 100% enables partial overbooking of the transmit cell memory. Specifying values for this attribute under the three AtmIf's where the sum of these attributes adds up to exactly 100%, ensures that each AtmIf has a dedicated pool of transmit cells with no overbooking. Specifying values for this attribute under the three AtmIf's where the sum of these attributes adds up to less than 100%, restricts the total size of the free list. This can be used to ensure the functioning of port aggregation even with a small number of connections. For 2pOc3MmAtm2 and 2pOC3SmAtm2 card types, the cell memory displayed in Lp/x Eng Arc Aqm/0 txCellMemoryThreshold 0 is allocated to the first interface for the card. Cell memory displayed in Lp/x Eng Arc Aqm/1 txCellMemoryThreshold 0 is allocated to the second interface for the card. Specifying an amount less than 100% restricts the total size of the free list. This can be used to ensure the functioning of port aggregation even with a small number of connections."

This attribute indicates which txCellMemoryThreshold corresponds to the current value of txCellMemoryUsage. The congestion state is used to determine if cells of a particular discard priority (DP) are discarded before being queued for transmit. The congestion state of transmit cell memory is indicated by a numeric value ranging from 3 to 0. When transmit cell memory is in congestion state 'x', traffic with DP > 'x' is discarded before transmit. Traffic with DP < 'x' may be queued for transmit, depending on the congestion level of the connection transmit queue. Traffic with DP = 'x' may be either queued or discarded depending on how close the value of txCellMemoryUsage is to the next threshold as displayed in txCellMemoryThreshold. For example, CLP1 traffic is queued until the value indicated by txCellMemoryUsage equals the value indicated in txCellMemoryThreshold 3. At that point, CLP1 traffic is discarded."

This attribute is not applicable, and is not displayed on CQC-based ATM FPs. Transmit cell memory used for storing ATM cells to be transmitted by connections under this AtmIf. It includes all cells in connections at the nrt-VBR or UBR service category. It includes cells in CBR or rt-VBR connections which are doing per-VC queueing. It does not include cells in CBR or rt-VBR connections which are allocated from the dedicated buffer for CBR common queuing or rt-VBR common queuing. The first value indicates the transmit cell memory size. It is the multiplication of the Lp/x Eng Arc Aqm/y txCellMemoryThreshold 0 attribute by the txCellMemoryPercentage attribute of this AtmIf. The current value of txCellMemoryUsage together with the vector of values in txCellMemoryThreshold determines the txCellMemoryCongestionState. The congestion state determines whether cells of a given discard priority (DP) are discarded or queued for transmit. When the txCellMemoryUsage attribute is between threshold 0 and threshold 1, the txCellMemoryCongestionState indicates the value 0. In congestion state 0, traffic with DP > 0 is discarded. Threshold 1 is set approximately at 90 percent of threshold 0, the total transmit cell memory size. When the txCellMemoryUsage attribute is between threshold 1 and threshold 2, the txCellMemoryCongestionState indicates the value 1. In congestion state 1, traffic with DP > 1 is discarded. Threshold 2 is set approximately at 85 percent of threshold 0, the total transmit cell memory size. When the txCellMemoryUsage attribute is between threshold 2 and threshold 3, the txCellMemoryCongestionState indicates the value 2. In congestion state 2, traffic with DP > 2 is discarded. Threshold 3 is set approximately at 75 percent of threshold 0, the total transmit cell memory size. When the txCellMemoryUsage attribute is below threshold 3, the txCellMemoryCongestionState indicates the value 3. In congestion state 3, traffic with DP=3 is queued."

Please refer to the Override component below for the current provisioning group This group contains provisionable attributes which specify the VCC space to be supported by an ATM interface. The VCC space consists of an optional 'VPI Zero VCC Space' and an optional 'Programmable VCC Space'. The VPI Zero VCC Space is used to support VCCs with a VPI of zero. The VCI values supported in this space range from 0 to a provisioned maximum. The size of the VPI Zero VCC Space must either be 0 or a multiple of 256. A value of 0 implies that no programmable VCCs can be used. In this case atmNumberOfNonZeroVpisForVccs_m must also be 0. The optional Programmable VCC Space is used to support VCCs with a VPI other than zero. The VPI values supported in this space must lie in a single contiguous range which excludes VPI 0. The VCI values supported in this space range from 0 to a provisioned maximum. The size of the Programmable VCC Space (should it exist) must adhere to the following rules: If (firstNonZeroVpiForVccs = 1) THEN (numNonZeroVpisForVccs + 1) * numVccsPerNonZeroVpi must be a multiple of 256 OTHERWISE numNonZeroVpisForVccs * numVccsPerNonZeroVpi must be a multiple of 256 If the AtmIf is linked to a LogicalProcessor with a cardType of 3pE3Atm, 3pDS3Atm, 3pOC3MmAtm, 3pOC3SmAtm, 3pE1Atm, 3pDS1Atm or 2pJ6MAtm, the size of the entire VCC space (both mandatory and optional parts) and VPC space must not exceed the capacity of the port to which the interface is linked, which is defined in the Arc component's totalConnectionPoolCapacity or connectionPoolCapacity attribute (whichever is non-zero). When using the totalConnectionPoolCapacity attribute, the capacity of the port is (totalConnectionPoolCapacity divided by the number of physical ports). The number of connection identifiers in the VCC and VPC space can be determined as follows: IF (numNonZeroVpisForVccs = 0) THEN number of connection ids = 256 + numVccsForVpiZero OTHERWISE IF (firstNonZeroVpiForVccs = 1) THEN number of connection ids = 256 + numVccsForVpiZero + (numNonZeroVpisForVccs + 1) * numVccsPerNonZeroVpi OTHERWISE number of connection ids = 256 + numVccsForVpiZero + (numNonZeroVpisForVccs * numVccsPerNonZeroVpi)"

The VCC space consists of an optional 'VPI Zero VCC Space' and an optional 'Programmable VCC Space'. The VPI Zero VCC Space is used to support VCCs with a VPI of zero. The VCI values supported in this space range from 0 to an optionally provisioned maximum of numVccsForVpiZero. The size of the VPI Zero VCC Space is either 0 or a multiple of 256. A value of 0 implies that not only can no VCCs be provisioned in the VPI Zero VCC Space but no Programmable VCCs can be used. In this case numNonZeroVpisForVccs will also be 0. The optional Programmable VCC Space supports VCCs with a VPI other than zero. The VPI values supported in this space lie in a single contiguous range which excludes VPI 0. The VCI values supported in this space range from 0 to an optionally provisioned maximum. The number of connection identifier resources in the VCC and VPC space (not all of which are available for user connections) is the value reported in the Lp/n Eng Arc totalConnectionPoolAvailable attribute divided by the number of physical ports on the card, and can be determined as follows: IF (numNonZeroVpisForVccs = 0) THEN number of connection ID resources = 256 + numVccsForVpiZero OTHERWISE IF (firstNonZeroVpiForVccs = 1) THEN number of connection ID resources = 256 + numVccsForVpiZero + (numNonZeroVpisForVccs + 1) * numVccsPerNonZeroVpi OTHERWISE number of connection ID resources = 256 + numVccsForVpiZero + (numNonZeroVpisForVccs * numVccsPerNonZeroVpi)"

The size of the Programmable VCC Space (should it exist) must adhere to the following rules: If (firstNonZeroVpiForVccs = 1) THEN (numNonZeroVpisForVccs + 1) * numVccsPerNonZeroVpi must be a multiple of 256 OTHERWISE numNonZeroVpisForVccs * numVccsPerNonZeroVpi must be a multiple of 256 The number of connection identifier resources in the VCC and VPC space can be determined as follows: The number of connection identifier resources in the VCC and VPC space (not all of which are available for user connections) is reported in the Lp/n Eng Arc totalConnectionPoolAvailable attribute, and can be determined as follows: IF (numNonZeroVpisForVccs = 0) THEN number of connection ID resources = 256 + numVccsForVpiZero OTHERWISE IF (firstNonZeroVpiForVccs = 1) THEN number of connection ID resources = 256 + numVccsForVpiZero + (numNonZeroVpisForVccs + 1) * numVccsPerNonZeroVpi OTHERWISE number of connection ID resources = 256 + numVccsForVpiZero + (numNonZeroVpisForVccs * numVccsPerNonZeroVpi) The number of connection identifier resources must not exceed the capacity of the port to which the interface is linked. If the Lp has an Eng Arc Cqc Ov component provisioned with a non-zero connectionPoolCapacity the port's capacity is specified by this attribute. Otherwise the port's capacity is indicated by the Lp/n Eng Arc totalConnectionPoolAvailable divided by the number of physical ports on the card."

This attribute specifies the tolerable cell loss ratio (CLR) for nrt- VBR traffic. The number is the logarithm (base 10) of the CLR. In other words if the target CLR = 1E-10 then vbrNrtCellLossRatio = - 10.This number must be greater than or equal to vbrRtCellLossRatio since rt-VBR traffic has a higher discard priority. The vbrNrtCellLossRatio is used by the Connection Admission Control (CAC) algorithm to compute the required (equivalent) cell rate for nrt-VBR connections. There is a trade-off between the service category CLR and the achievable link utilization. To guarantee an excellent service category, the CLR should be as small as possible (e.g., 1E-10). However, a smaller CLR results in a larger equivalent cell rate for a given connection and hence a lower link utilization."

The Cbr cellLossRatio is used by the Connection Admission Control (CAC) algorithm to compute the required (equivalent) cell rate for CBR connections. There is a trade-off between the service category CLR and the achievable link utilization. To guarantee an excellent service category, the CLR should be as small as possible (e.g., 1E-10). However, a smaller CLR results in a larger equivalent cell rate for a given connection and hence a lower link utilization. Setting this attribute to 0 means that a CLR of 1 can be tolerated. In this case, no bandwidth is reserved for CBR connections, and CAC is effectively turned off. All CBR connections are admitted."

For a per-VC queue, the actual limit may be reduced depending on the shaping rate of the connection (for standard Vpt Vccs, this is the shaping rate of the Vpt). The discard thresholds are set at approximately 35, 75 and 90 percent of the scaled queue limit for traffic at discard priority 3 (DP=3), DP=2 and DP=1 respectively. However, a reduction will never result in a value that is less than the value set for the minPerVcQueueLimit attribute. CQC-based ATM cards do not support per-VC queues at the CBR service category. When this attribute is set to autoConfigure, an appropriate value is selected based on the card type. It is set to 96 for all Passport ATM cards (DS1, E1, IMA, JT2, DS3, E3, OC3, both CQC-based cards and ATM IP cards). For ATM IP FPs, the per-VC queue limit may be overridden for a permanent connection by specifying a value in the Vcd Tm or Vpd Tm txQueueLimit attribute. The operational value of the maximum length of a queue (common or per-VC) is indicated by the Vcc Tm, Vpc Tm, or Vpt Tm txQueueThresholds attribute. For standard Vpts, this attribute does not apply when using per-VC queuing and only applies when using common queueing. When using per-VC queueing, regardless of the Vpt's service category, standard Vpts use the AtmIf Ca NrtVbr txQueueLimit value as their default. This attribute does not apply to basic Vpts.

This attribute affects how the transmit time is calculated for the next cell on the delayed connection. This attribute is ignored if this service category is not shaped. When the connection which was delayed schedules the next cell to transmit, it may calculate the time as a difference from either the previous actual cell transmit time, or the time when the previous cell should have been transmitted. Setting this attribute to maximumEfficiency results in each connection trying to recoup or regain any delays in scheduling. The transmit time from the next cell is calculated from the time when the cell should originally have been sent. Cell delay variation (CDV) occurs in this case since the cells are sent with less than the shaping delay between them. However, in general the shaper recovers (recoups) lost opportunities and improves efficiency. Setting this attribute to minimumCdv results in connections not trying to recoup or regain any delays in scheduling. The transmit time for the next cell is calculated from the time when the previous cell was actually transmitted. This minimizes CDV, but results in missed cell opportunities.

The number is the negative logarithm (base 10) of the CLR. For example, if the target CLR = 1E-10 then RtVbr cellLossRatio = 10. This number must be the same as the Cbr cellLossRatio since CBR and rt-VBR traffic have the same discard priority. The RtVbr cellLossRatio is used by the Connection Admission Control (CAC) algorithm to compute the required (equivalent) cell rate for rt-VBR connections. This number must be less than or equal to the NrtVbr cellLossRatio, since rt-VBR traffic has a higher discard priority. There is a trade-off between the service category CLR and the achievable link utilization. To guarantee an excellent service category, the CLR should be as small as possible (e.g., 1E-10). However, a smaller CLR results in a larger equivalent cell rate for a given connection and hence a lower link utilization. Setting this attribute to 0 means that a CLR of 1 can be tolerated. In this case, no bandwidth is reserved for rt-VBR connections, and CAC is effectively turned off. All rt-VBR are admitted."

CBR and rt-VBR may be placed either in the absolute priority range (EP 0 or 1) or in the guaranteed bandwidth range (EP 2 through 7). 4. If both CBR and rt-VBR are shaped, rt-VBR must share the same EP with CBR or ABR. If either one of CBR or rt-VBR are not shaped, then they cannot share the same EP. 5. ABR service category is always deemed to be shaped. If nrt-VBR is shaped, it must share the same EP with ABR. If nrt-VBR is not shaped it must have a higher EP than ABR. 6. If UBR is shaped, it must share the same EP with ABR. If UBR is not shaped, it must have a lower EP than ABR. This attribute does not apply to standard Vpt Vccs and basic Vpts."

This is the policy which is used to recoup shaping opportunities which are lost when more than one connection schedules a cell for the same transmit opportunity. In this case, one connection is scheduled, and the cell from another connection is delayed by one cell time. This attribute affects how the transmit time is calculated for the next cell on the delayed connection. This attribute is ignored if this service category is not shaped. When the connection which was delayed schedules the next cell to transmit, it may calculate the time as a difference from either the previous actual cell transmit time, or the time when the previous cell should have been transmitted. Setting this attribute to maximumEfficiency results in each connection trying to recoup or regain delays in scheduling. The transmit time from the next cell is calculated from the time when the cell should originally have been sent. Cell delay variation (CDV) occurs in this case since the cells are sent with less than the shaping delay between them. However, in general the shaper recovers (recoups) lost opportunities and improves efficiency. Setting this attribute to minimumCdv results in connections not trying to recoup or regain any delays in scheduling. The transmit time for the next cell is calculated from the time when the previous cell was actually transmitted. This minimizes CDV, but results in missed cell opportunities."

For connections with txTrafficDescType 3, which have no SCR, the sustained cell rate is assumed to be equal to the peak cell rate. If this attribute is set to pcr, the fairness weight is proportional to the transmit peak cell rate (PCR) of a connection. Connections with a higher PCR have a higher fairness weight.

The number is the negative logarithm (base 10) of the CLR. In other words if the target CLR = 1E-10 then NrtVbr cellLossRatio = 10. This number must be greater than or equal to RtVbr cellLossRatio since rt-VBR traffic has a higher discard priority. The NrtVbr cellLossRatio is used by the Connection Admission Control (CAC) algorithm to compute the required (equivalent) cell rate for nrt-VBR connections. There is a trade-off between the service category CLR and the achievable link utilization. To guarantee an excellent service category, the CLR should be as small as possible (e.g., 1E-10). However, a smaller CLR results in a larger equivalent cell rate for a given connection and hence a lower link utilization. Setting this attribute to 0 means that a CLR of 1 can be tolerated. In this case no bandwidth is reserved for nrt-VBR connections, and CAC is effectively turned off. All nrt-VBR connections are admitted."

The fairness weight for a connection determines the relative amount of bandwidth which that connection obtains, compared to other connections in the same service category. Connections with equal weight get equal transmit opportunities. Connections with higher weights get more transmit opportunities compared with connections that have lower weights. An override to this default may be specified for a provisioned connection under the Vcd Tm or Vpd Tm component. The fairness weight for a connection is directly proportional to the value of one of the traffic descriptor parameters for that connection. This attribute specifies which traffic descriptor parameter is used for connections of the nrt-VBR service category. This attribute is ignored on CQC-based ATM cards. This attribute is also ignored on ATM IP cards if unshapedTransmitQueueing is set for common queuing. If this attribute is set to scr, the fairness weight is proportional to the transmit sustained cell rate (SCR) of a connection. Connections with a higher SCR have a higher fairness weight. For connections with txTrafficDescType 3, which have no SCR, the sustained cell rate is assumed to be equal to the peak cell rate. If this attribute is set to pcr, the fairness weight is proportional to the transmit peak cell rate (PCR) of a connection. Connections with a higher PCR have a higher fairness weight. Connections with txTrafficDescType 1 or 2 get a minimum weight, which is 1. If this attribute is set to ecr, the fairness weight is proportional to the equivalent cell rate (ECR) of a connection as calculated by connection admission control (CAC). Connections with a higher ECR have a higher fairness weight. Connections with an ECR of 0 get a minimum weight, which is 1. The weight of a connection is visible in the Vcc Tm, Vpc Tm, or Vpt Tm weight attribute. This attribute does not apply to standard Vpt Vccs and basic Vpts."

This attribute specifies the emission priority (EP) which is used to transmit traffic of the ABR service category. A lower numerical value for this attribute specifies a higher emission priority. 0 is the highest EP and 7 is the lowest. Cells at a higher emission priority receive higher preference for link bandwidth. EPs 0 and 1 are in the absolute priority range, and are unaffected by any minimum bandwidth guarantees. EPs 2 through 7 are in the guaranteed bandwidth range. Minimum bandwidth guarantee is specified in the AtmIf/n Ep/m component. Emission priority setting must comply with all of the following constraints: 1. The emission priority numbers must be in the following order: CBR <= rt-VBR <= nrt-VBR <= ABR <= UBR 2. Two different ATM service categories may share the same EP only if they are both shaped. 3. CBR and rt-VBR may be placed either in the absolute priority range (EP 0 or 1) or in the guaranteed bandwidth range (EP 2 through 7). 4. If both CBR and rt-VBR are shaped, rt-VBR must share the same EP with CBR or ABR. If either one of CBR or rt-VBR are not shaped, then they cannot share the same EP. 5. ABR service category is always deemed to be shaped. If nrt-VBR is shaped, it must share the same EP with ABR. If nrt-VBR is not shaped it must have a higher EP than ABR. 6. If UBR is shaped, it must share the same EP with ABR. If UBR is not shaped, it must have a lower EP than ABR. This attribute does not apply to standard Vpt Vccs and basic Vpts."

A Virtual Source- Virtual Destination (VS/VD) boundary forms a break in the end to end flow of RM cells as defined in the ATM Forum Specification for Traffic Management Version 4.0. On ATM IP cards, a VS/VD boundary can be configured for a connection providing all of the following conditions are met: 1. the ABR connection is traversing (not terminating at) this interface; 2. both this interface and next hop interface to which traffic is directed across the backplane are located on ATM IP cards; 3. one or both connecting points are configured as virtualSourceDest, 4. the next hop interface to which traffic is directed across the backplane is not configured as nonAbrInterworking, 5. the connection is not a Vcc under a standard VPT.

ADTF is the time interval permitted between sending forward Resource Management (F-RM) cells before the Allowed Cell Rate (ACR) is decreased to the Initial Cell Rate (ICR). In other words, if the source does not transmit a forward RM cell for a period of ADTF centi-seconds (hundredths of a second), it will reduce its ACR to the value of its ICR. If ACR is already at or below ICR, further rate reductions are defined by the CRM ABR parameter."

However, in general the shaper recovers (recoups) lost opportunities and improves efficiency.

Its value reflects whether the rate of received OAM cells for this connection is below a specified threshold. The connection maintains a count of the number of OAM cells which are terminated per second. Once that count exceeds the specified threshold, extraction of all OAM cells for this connection is disabled for a period of one minute. This is a congestion management mechanism to prevent the processor from being overloaded with handling OAM cells for a particular connection. This mechanism ensures that tasks, such as trunks obtain enough processor cycles to remain in service, and are not adversely affected by excessive rate of OAM cells on a particular connection. The value is good when the rate of received OAM cells is less than the allowed threshold. The value is bad when the arrival rate has exceeded the allowed threshold. It remains bad for one minute, before returning to good again. During this timeout, extraction of all OAM cells is disabled for this connection. As a result, other loopback failure conditions may occur. The value is unknown when the application has not yet begun to use this connection. An example is the Test component before a test has been started. Each type of OAM cell is counted separately. The threshold for AIS cells is three cells per second. If more than three AIS cells are received within a one second interval, this attribute is set to bad. The threshold for RDI cells and each loopback type is also three, but the threshold for trace cells is 250 per second.

Real time VBR service may support statistical multiplexing of real time sources. The nrtVariableBitRate service category is intended for non-real time applications which have bursty traffic characteristics and which can be characterized in terms of a PCR, SCR, and MBS. For those cells which are transferred within the traffic contract, the application expects a low cell loss ratio. For all connections, it expects a bound on the mean cell transfer delay. Non-real time VBR service may support statistical multiplexing of connections. The unspecifiedBitRate service is intended for non-real time applications, that is those not requiring tightly constrained delay and delay variation. UBR sources are expected to be bursty. UBR service supports a high degree of statistical multiplexing among sources. UBR service does not specify traffic related service guarantees. No numerical commitments are made with respect to the cell loss ratio experienced by a UBR connection, or as to the cell transfer delay experienced by cells on the connection."

When txTrafficDescType is 4, parameter 1 represents the PCR for CLP equal to 0 and 1 traffic; parameter 2 represents the PCR for CLP equal to 0 traffic with cell discard. When txTrafficDescType is 5, parameter 1 represents the PCR for CLP equal to 0 and 1 traffic; parameter 2 represents the PCR for CLP equal to 0 traffic with cell tagging.

    "description": "This attribute is HISTORICAL. Please refer to the attribute of the same name in the group AtmTmOper. This attribute is a vector of four traffic parameters whose meanings are defined by the rxTrafficDescType attribute. The values of peak cell rate (PCR), sustained cell rate (SCR) are expressed in cells/s. Maximum burst size (MBS) is expressed in cells. Cell Delay Variation Tolerance (CDVT) is expressed in microseconds. When rxTrafficDescType is 1 or 2, none of the parameters are used. When rxTrafficDescType is 3, parameter 1 represents the PCR for CLP equal to 0 and 1 traffic; parameter 4 represents the CDVT. When rxTrafficDescType is 4, parameter 1 represents the PCR for CLP equal to 0 and 1 traffic; parameter 2 represents the PCR for CLP equal to 0 traffic with cell discard; parameter 4 represents the CDVT. When rxTrafficDescType is 5, parameter 1 represents the PCR for CLP equal to 0 and 1 traffic; parameter 2 represents the PCR for CLP equal to 0 traffic with cell tagging; parameter 4 represents the CDVT. When rxTrafficDescType is a 6, parameter 1 represents the PCR for CLP equal to 0 and 1 traffic; parameter 2 represents the SCR for CLP equal to 0 and 1 traffic; parameter 3 represents the MBS for CLP equal to 0 and 1 traffic; parameter 4 represents the CDVT. When rxTrafficDescType is 7, parameter 1 represents the PCR for CLP equal to 0 and 1 traffic; parameter 2 represents the SCR for CLP equal to 0 traffic with cell discard; parameter 3 represents the MBS for CLP equal to 0 traffic; parameter 4 represents the CDVT. When rxTrafficDescType is 8, parameter 1 represents the PCR for CLP equal to 0 and 1 traffic; parameter 2 represents the SCR for CLP equal to 0 traffic with cell tagging; parameter 3 represents the MBS for CLP equal to 0 traffic; parameter 4 represents the CDVT. If Upc is disabled for this connection, the values of PCR, SCR, MBS and CDVT is a combination of provisioned parameters. If Upc is enabled, the values of PCR, SCR, MBS, and CDVT is exactly the values used by the usage parameter control hardware in policing the arriving traffic. These may vary slightly from the provisioned values due to granularity of the hardware. In the case where the PCR is equal to the SCR, the effective MBS is zero."

Depending upon the atmServiceCategory of the connection, the provisioned value of the transmit queue limit is derived from the txQueueLimit attribute under one of the subcomponents of the AtmIf CA component. If the connection has traffic shaping disabled, then this attribute relates to the common queue. If traffic shaping is enabled, then this attribute relates to the per-VC queue. The second element is the threshold that marks the transition from congestion state 1 to congestion state 0. This is the threshold at which traffic with discard priority (DP) = 1 is discarded. This threshold is set approximately at 90 percent of the first parameter, the operational queue limit. The third element is the threshold that marks the transition from congestion state 2 to congestion state 1. This is the threshold at which traffic with DP = 2 is discarded. This threshold is set approximately at 75 percent of the first parameter, the operational queue limit.

The value derivedFromBBC may only be used if the SrcPvc component is provisioned under this Vcc.Otherwise a specific ATM service category must be specified. If this attribute is set to derivedFromBBC, the Broadband Bearer Capability (BBC) and bestEffort attributes are used to determine the atmServiceCategory of this connection. If this attribute is set to other than derivedFromBBC, the value of this attribute is used to override the provisioned BBC Information Element parameters. In those cases, the BBC attributes are not used. The constantBitRate service category is intended for real time applications, that is those requiring tightly constrained delay and delay variation, as would be appropriate for voice and video applications. The consistent availability of a fixed quantity of bandwidth is considered appropriate for CBR service. Cells which are delayed beyond the value specified by Cell Transfer Delay are assumed to be of significantly reduce value to the application. The rtVariableBitRate service category is intended for real time applications, that is those requiring tightly constrained delay and delay variation, as would be appropriate for voice and video applications. Sources are expected to transmit at a rate which varies with time. Equivalently, the source can be described as 'bursty'. Cells which are delayed beyond the value specified by CTD are assumed to be of significantly reduced value to the application. Real time VBR service may support statistical multiplexing of real time sources. The nrtVariableBitRate service category is intended for non-real time applications which have bursty traffic characteristics and which can be characterized in terms of a PCR, SCR, and MBS. For those cells which are transferred within the traffic contract, the application expects a low cell loss ratio. For all connections, it expects a bound on the mean cell transfer delay. Non-real time VBR service may support statistical multiplexing of connections. The unspecifiedBitRate service is intended for non-real time applications; that is, those not requiring tightly constrained delay and delay variation. UBR sources are expected to be bursty. UBR service supports a high degree of statistical multiplexing among sources. UBR service does not specify traffic related service guarantees. No numerical commitments are made with respect to the cell loss ratio experienced by a UBR connection, or as to the cell transfer delay experienced by cells on the connection."

The network may look at the AAL to provide interworking based upon its contents. Class c service is a connection-oriented, variable bit rate ATM transport service. Class c service has no end-to-end timing requirements. When c is set, the user is requesting more than an ATM only service. The network interworking function may look at the AAL and provide service based on it. Class x service is a connection-oriented ATM transport service where the AAL, trafficType (vbr or cbr) and timing requirements are user defined (that is, transparent to the network).When x is set the user is requesting an ATM only service from the network. Class vp service is used to specify a transparent VP service. When the value of this attribute is vp, the user is requesting an ATM only service from the network. In this case, the network shall not process any higher layer protocol.

The values of peak cell rate (PCR), sustained cell rate (SCR) and requested shaping rate are expressed in cell/s. Maximum burst size (MBS) is expressed in cells. CDVT is expressed in microseconds. The values of PCR, SCR, MBS and CDVT are used for connection admission control (CAC). The value of CDVT is only used for connections where the atmServiceCategory is constantBitRate. For all other values of atmServiceCategory, CDVT is ignored. The values of PCR, SCR and requested shaping rate are used to determine the actual shaping rate where traffic shaping is enabled. When txTrafficDescType is 1 or 2, all of the parameters must be set to zero. When txTrafficDescType is 3, parameter 1 represents the PCR for CLP equal to 0 and 1 traffic; parameter 4 represents the CDVT; and parameter 5 represents the requested shaping rate. A non-zero value in parameter 5 overrides any value in parameter 1. This result is used as the PCR. Parameter 1 must be non-zero. Parameters 2 and 3 must be zero. When txTrafficDescType is 4, parameter 1 represents the PCR for CLP equal to 0 and 1 traffic with cell discard; parameter 2 represents the PCR for CLP equal to 0 traffic; parameter 4 represents the CDVT; and parameter 5 represents the requested shaping rate. A non-zero value in parameter 5 overrides any value in parameter 1. This result is used as the PCR. Parameter 1 must be greater than or equal to parameter 2. Parameters 1 and 2 must be non-zero. Parameter 3 must be zero. When txTrafficDescType is 5, parameter 1 represents the PCR for CLP equal to 0 and 1 traffic with cell tagging; parameter 2 represents the PCR for CLP equal to 0 traffic; parameter 4 represents the CDVT; and parameter 5 represents the requested shaping rate. A non-zero value in parameter 5 overrides any value in parameter 1. This result is used as the PCR. Parameter 1 must be greater than or equal to parameter 2. Parameters 1 and 2 must be non-zero. Parameter 3 must be zero. When txTrafficDescType is 6, parameter 1 represents the PCR for CLP equal to 0 and 1 traffic; parameter 2 represents the SCR for CLP equal to 0 and 1 traffic; parameter 3 represents the MBS for CLP equal to 0 and 1 traffic; parameter 4 represents the CDVT; and parameter 5 represents the requested shaping rate. A non-zero value in parameter 5 overrides any value in parameter 1. This result is used as the PCR. Parameters 1, 2 and 3 must be non-zero. Parameter 1 must be greater than or equal to parameter 2. Parameter 5, must either be zero (unused) or greater than or equal to parameter 2. When txTrafficDescType is 7, parameter 1 represents the PCR for CLP equal to 0 and 1 traffic; parameter 2 represents the SCR for CLP equal to 0 with cell discard; parameter 3 represents the MBS for CLP equal to 0 traffic; parameter 4 represents the CDVT; and parameter 5 represents the requested shaping rate. A non-zero value in parameter 5 overrides any value in parameter 1. This result is used as the PCR. Parameters 1, 2 and 3 must be non-zero. Parameter 1 must be greater than or equal to parameter 2. Parameter 5, must either be zero (unused) or greater than or equal to parameter 2. When txTrafficDescType is 8, parameter 1 represents the PCR for CLP equal to 0 and 1 traffic; parameter 2 represents the SCR for CLP equal to 0 traffic with cell tagging; parameter 3 represents the MBS for CLP equal to 0 traffic; parameter 4 represents the CDVT; and parameter 5 represents the requested shaping rate.

Parameter 5, must either be zero (unused) or greater than or equal to parameter 2. Whenever it is valid for PCR to be specified, parameter 5 may also be used to specify a requested shaping rate. A non-zero value in parameter 5 overrides the value in parameter 1 and is used as the peak cell rate in calculations of CAC and shaping rate. For txTrafficDescType 3, 4 and 5, the transmit traffic is shaped at the next rate less than the PCR. For txTrafficDescType 6, 7 and 8, the transmit traffic is shaped at the highest available rate which is between PCR and SCR.

    "description": "This attribute is migrated to the AtmTmProv group. This attribute is a vector of four traffic parameters whose meanings are defined by the rxTrafficDescType attribute. The values of peak cell rate (PCR) and sustained cell rate (SCR) are expressed in cell/s. Maximum burst size (MBS) is expressed in cells. The value of CDVT is expressed in microseconds. The values of PCR, SCR, MBS and CDVT are used for usage parameter control (UPC). When rxTrafficDescType is 1 or 2, all of the parameters must be set to zero (unused). When rxTrafficDescType is 3, parameter 1 represents the PCR for CLP equal to 0 and 1 traffic. Parameter 1 must be non-zero. Parameters 2 and 3 must be set to zero (unused). When rxTrafficDescType is 4, parameter 1 represents the PCR for CLP equal to 0 and 1 traffic; parameter 2 represents the PCR for CLP equal to 0 traffic with cell discard. Parameters 1 and 2 must be non-zero. Parameter 3 must be set to zero (unused). Parameter 1 must be greater than or equal to parameter 2. When rxTrafficDescType is 5, parameter 1 represents the PCR for CLP equal to 0 and 1 traffic; parameter 2 represents the PCR for CLP equal to 0 traffic with cell tagging. Parameters 1 and 2 must be non-zero. Parameter 3 must be set to zero (unused). Parameter 1 must be greater than or equal to parameter 2. When rxTrafficDescType is a 6, parameter 1 represents the PCR for CLP equal to 0 and 1 traffic; parameter 2 represents the SCR for CLP equal to 0 and 1 traffic; parameter 3 represents the MBS for CLP equal to 0 and 1 traffic. Parameters 1, 2 and 3 must be non- zero. Parameter 1 must be greater than or equal to Parameter 2. When rxTrafficDescType is 7, parameter 1 represents the PCR for CLP equal to 0 and 1 traffic; parameter 2 represents the SCR for CLP equal to 0 traffic with cell discard; parameter 3 represents the MBS for CLP equal to 0 traffic. Parameters 1, 2 and 3 must be non- zero. Parameter 1 must be greater than or equal to parameter 2. When rxTrafficDescType is 8, parameter 1 represents the PCR for CLP equal to 0 and 1 traffic; parameter 2 represents the SCR for CLP equal to 0 traffic with cell tagging; parameter 3 represents the MBS for CLP equal to 0 traffic. Parameter 1, 2 and 3 must be non- zero. Parameter 1 must be greater than or equal to parameter 2. When rxTrafficDescType is any value from 3 through 8, parameter 4 represents the CDVT. If this value is zero, the CDVT is taken from the ConnectionAdministrator defaults for the particular atmServiceCategory of this connection. When rxTrafficDescriptorType is 3 through 8, there are certain extreme combinations of rxTrafficDescParm which are outside the capabilities of the UPC hardware. The check prov command detects such cases and generates an error message. If this happens, adjust the parameters until they fall within the supported limits. To calculate the limits, use the following formulae: I1 = 1 000 000 000 / PCR L1 = CDVT * 1000 I2 = 1 000 000 000 / SCR L2 = CDVT + (MBS - 1) * (I2 - I1) I1 and I2 must be less than or equal to 335 523 840. I1 + L1 must be less than or equal to 1 342 156 800. I2 + L2 must be less than or equal to 1 342 156 800. Note that I2 and L2 only apply when the rxTrafficDescriptorType is 6 through 8. If the values of I1, L1, I2 or L2 are closer to the limits described above, a further restriction applies. Specifically, if either: I1 > 41 940 480 or I2 > 41 940 480 or I1 + L1 > 167 769 600 or I2 + L2 > 167 769 600 then both I1 and I2 must be greater than 20 480. Parameter 5 of the rxTrafficDescParm is always unused. If the rxTrafficDescType is sameAsTx, the values in this attribute are taken from the txTrafficDescParm."

If this attribute is set to other than derivedFromBBC, the value of this attribute is used to override the provisioned BBC Information Element parameters. In those cases, the BBC attributes are not used. The constantBitRate service category is intended for real time applications, that is those requiring tightly constrained delay and delay variation, as would be appropriate for voice and video applications. The consistent availability of a fixed quantity of bandwidth is considered appropriate for CBR service. Cells which are delayed beyond the value specified by Cell Transfer Delay are assumed to be of significantly reduced value to the application. The rtVariableBitRate service category is intended for real time applications, that is those requiring tightly constrained delay and delay variation, as would be appropriate for voice and video applications. Sources are expected to transmit at a rate which varies with time. Equivalently, the source can be described as 'bursty'. Cells which are delayed beyond the value specified by CTD are assumed to be of significantly reduced value to the application. Real time VBR service may support statistical multiplexing of real time sources. The nrtVariableBitRate service category is intended for non-real time applications which have bursty traffic characteristics and which can be characterized in terms of a PCR, SCR, and MBS. For those cells which are transferred within the traffic contract, the application expects a low cell loss ratio. For all connections, it expects a bound on the mean cell transfer delay. Non-real time VBR service may support statistical multiplexing of connections. The availableBitRate service is an ATM layer service category for which the limiting ATM layer transfer characteristics provided by the network may change subsequent to connection establishment. ABR service has a flow control mechanism which supports several types of feedback to control the source rate in response to changing ATM layer transfer characteristics. ABR service is not intended to support real-time applications. The unspecifiedBitRate service is intended for non-real time applications; that is, those not requiring tightly constrained delay and delay variation. UBR sources are expected to be bursty. UBR service supports a high degree of statistical multiplexing among sources. UBR service does not specify traffic related service guarantees. No numerical commitments are made with respect to the cell loss ratio experienced by a UBR connection, or as to the cell transfer delay experienced by cells on the connection."

Packet-wise discard functions should only be requested if this connection is transferring AAL5 frame traffic. This attribute is not applicable for Vpts. Packet-wise functions increase the 'goodput' of the link. The transmit packet-wise functions are Early Packet Discard (EPD) and Partial Packet Discard (PPD). EPD allows the connection to discard an entire frame once the transmit queue has reached the EPD threshold. EPD increases the 'goodput' of a link, since discarding an entire frame means that some queue capacity is guarded for some other frame which is already partially transmitted. All cells of the frame are discarded from the Beginning of Message (BOM) cell up to and including the End of Message (EOM) cell. PPD allows the connection to discard the remainder of a cell- forwarded AAL5 frame if one cell of this frame has been discarded. All cells are discarded up to but not including the EOM cell. The PPD function increases the 'goodput' of the link, since cells which are only going to be discarded at the AAL5 reassembly point are not transmitted. On CQC-based ATM cards, the packet-wise discard functions are PPD and EPD. PPD is available at VCC cell-transfer points. PPD is not applicable at frame-cell conversion points, and is not applicable for Vpcs. PPD is configured by this attribute. Packet-wise discard should only be enabled for connections carrying AAL5 segmentation traffic. Setting the value to enabled for any other traffic type may result in all traffic being discarded. On CQC-based ATM FPs, EPD is automatically enabled at frame-to-cell conversion points, independent of the setting of this attribute. On ATM IP cards, packet-wise discard functions include EPD and PPD. PPD and EPD apply to individual VCCs and VCCs within VPCs at all connection points, including tandem VPC connections. Both PPD and EPD are controlled by this attribute. This attribute may safely be set to enabled for any connection (Vcc or Vpc) on ATM IP FPs since they have the ability to automatically detect AAL5-segmented traffic on a connection, and only enable packet- wise discards if AAL5-segmented traffic is detected. When this attribute is set to enabled, packet-wise discard functions are applied to transmit traffic at this connection point. When this attribute is set to disabled, packet-wise discard functions are not applied to transmit traffic at this connection point. At a SPVC origin on a PNNI interface, a value of enabled specifies that frame discard is requested in the backward direction. When this attribute is set to disabled, backward frame discard is not requested in the SPVC call setup.

The values of PCR, SCR, MCR and requested shaping rate are used to determine the actual shaping rate where traffic shaping is enabled. When txTrafficDescType is 1 or 2, all of the parameters must be set to zero. When txTrafficDescType is 3, parameter 1 represents the PCR for CLP equal to 0 and 1 traffic; parameter 4 represents the CDVT; and parameter 5 represents the requested shaping rate. A non-zero value in parameter 5 overrides any value in parameter 1. This result is used as the PCR. Parameter 1 must be non-zero. Parameters 2 and 3 must be zero. When txTrafficDescType is 4, parameter 1 represents the PCR for CLP equal to 0 and 1 traffic with cell discard; parameter 2 represents the PCR for CLP equal to 0 traffic; parameter 4 represents the CDVT; and parameter 5 represents the requested shaping rate.

When txTrafficDescType is 7, parameter 1 represents the PCR for CLP equal to 0 and 1 traffic; parameter 2 represents the SCR for CLP equal to 0 with cell discard; parameter 3 represents the MBS for CLP equal to 0 traffic; parameter 4 represents the CDVT; and parameter 5 represents the requested shaping rate. A non-zero value in parameter 5 overrides any value in parameter 1. This result is used as the PCR. Parameters 1, 2 and 3 must be non-zero. Parameter 1 must be greater than or equal to parameter 2.

Parameter 1 must be non-zero and must be greater than or equal to parameter 3. Parameter 3 may be optionally zero. Whenever it is valid for PCR to be specified, parameter 5 may also be used to specify a requested shaping rate. A non-zero value in parameter 5 overrides the value in parameter 1 and is used as the peak cell rate in calculations of CAC and shaping rate. When the atmServiceCategory is availableBitRate (ABR), the shaping rate is dynamically chosen, based on the ABR flow control mechanism, as a value between the MCR and the PCR or the requested shaping rate if applicable. For txTrafficDescType 3, 4 and 5, the transmit traffic is shaped at the next available shaping rate less than the PCR. For txTrafficDescType 6, 7 and 8 if linear traffic shaping is selected, the transmit traffic is shaped at the highest available rate which is between PCR and SCR. However, if there is no available shaping rate between PCR and SCR, traffic is shaped at the next rate above the PCR. For txTrafficDescType 6, 7 and 8 if inverse-UPC traffic shaping is selected, the transmit traffic is shaped at a variable rate which conforms to the PCR, SCR and MBS of the connection traffic descriptor. Inverse-UPC traffic shaping is available only on ATM IP cards."

If the value of CDVT either in parameter 2 or in parameter 4 is zero, the CDVT is taken from the CA defaults for the particular atmServiceCategory of this connection. On a CQC-based ATM card, when rxTrafficDescriptorType is 3 through 8, there are certain extreme combinations of rxTrafficDescParm which are outside the capabilities of the UPC hardware. The check prov command detects such cases and generates an error message. If this happens, adjust the parameters until they fall within the supported limits. To calculate the limits, use the following formulae: I1 = 1 000 000 000 / PCR L1 = CDVT * 1000 I2 = 1,000,000,000 / SCR L2 = CDVT + (MBS - 1) * (I2 - I1) I1 and I2 must be less than or equal to 335,523,840. I1 + L1 must be less than or equal to 1,342,156,800. I2 + L2 must be less than or equal to 1,342,156,800. Note that I2 and L2 only apply when the rxTrafficDescriptorType is 6 through 8. If the values of I1, L1, I2 or L2 are closer to the limits described above, a further restriction applies. Specifically, if either: I1 > 41,940,480 or I2 > 41,940,480 or I1 + L1 > 167,769,600 or I2 + L2 > 167,769,600 then both I1 and I2 must be greater than 20,480. Parameter 5 of the rxTrafficDescParm is always unused. If the rxTrafficDescType is sameAsTx, the values provisioned in this attribute are ignored. The traffic parameters for the receive direction are taken from the txTrafficDescParm."

The value of this attribute is used in policing an ABR connection using the Dynamic Generic Cell Rate Algorithm (DGCRA). A larger value for this attribute implies a more lenient policer. When the delay between two consecutive forward Resource Management (RM) cells received at this interface corresponds to a value greater than the farEndAcrDecreaseTimeFactor attribute, the policer begins to enforce the incoming traffic at the value of this attribute. If this attribute is specified less than the MCR of the connection, then the MCR is used as the feIcr. If this attribute is more than the PCR of the connection, then PCR is used as the feIcr.

This attribute does not apply to Virtual Link VPTs and will always be displayed as constantBitRate. The constantBitRate service category is intended for real time applications, that is, those requiring tightly constrained delay and delay variation, as would be appropriate for voice and video applications. The consistent availability of a fixed quantity of bandwidth is considered appropriate for CBR service. Cells which are delayed beyond the value specified by Cell Transfer Delay are assumed to have significantly reduced value for the application. The rtVariableBitRate service category is intended for real time applications; that is those requiring tightly constrained delay and delay variation, as would be appropriate for voice and video applications. Sources are expected to transmit at a rate which varies with time. Equivalently, the source can be described as 'bursty'. Cells which are delayed beyond the value specified by Cell Transfer Delay are assumed to be of significantly reduced value to the application. Real time VBR service may support statistical multiplexing of real time sources. The nrtVariableBitRate service category is intended for non-real time applications which have bursty traffic characteristics and which can be characterized in terms of a PCR, SCR, and MBS. For those cells which are transferred within the traffic contract, the application expects a low cell loss ratio. For all connections, it expects a bound on the mean cell transfer delay. Non-real time VBR service may support statistical multiplexing of connections. The availableBitRate service is an ATM layer service category for which the limiting ATM layer transfer characteristics provided by the network may change subsequent to connection establishment. ABR service has a flow control mechanism which supports several types of feedback to control the source rate in response to changing ATM layer transfer characteristics. ABR service is not intended to support real-time applications. The unspecifiedBitRate service is intended for non-real time applications, that is those not requiring tightly constrained delay and delay variation. UBR sources are expected to be bursty. UBR service supports a high degree of statistical multiplexing among sources. UBR service does not specify traffic related service guarantees. No numerical commitments are made with respect to the cell loss ratio experienced by a UBR connection, or as to the cell transfer delay experienced by cells on the connection."

A value of linear or inverseUpc indicates that traffic shaping is applicable and supported for the type of connection and has been turned on in the provisioning data. This is the only case that indicates that traffic shaping is performed on the connection. In this case, the actual shaping rate is reflected in the txTrafficDescParm attribute, parameter number 4. A value of linear indicates that traffic is being shaped at the constant rate indicated in txTrafficDescParm 4. A value of inverseUpc is possible only on ATM IP cards. This value indicates that the shaper strictly conforms to the requirements of a dual leaky bucket UPC enforcer. This value is indicated if traffic shaping is enabled, and the txTrafficDescType for this connection is 6, 7 or 8. Traffic shaping for connections with atmServiceCategory as availableBitRate (txTrafficDescType 9) depends upon the abrConnectionType attribute. If abrConnectionType is sourceDest or virtualSourceDest, the value of this attribute is dynamic. If abrConnectionType is erSwitch or efciSwitch, this attribute is notApplicable."

For CQC-based ATM cards, the set of available shaping rates is based on the number of interfaces doing shaping (attribute perVcQueueInterfaces), and the shapingScalingFactor attribute of the Arc Cqc Override component. A rate of zero (0) indicates that shaping is not performed, or that the interface is down. When txTrafficDescType is 9, parameter 1 represents the PCR; parameter 2 represents the Cell Delay Variation Toleration (CDVT); parameter 3 represents the Minimum Cell Rate (MCR); the meaning of parameter 4 depends upon the value of the abrConnectionType attribute. if abrConnectionType is sourceDest or virtualSourceDest, parameter 4 represents the Allowed Cell Rate (ACR); If abrConnectionType is erSwitch, parameter 4 represents the Explicit Rate (ER); and if abrConnectionType is efciSwitch, parameter 4 reflects the actual shaping rate in cell/s for this connection. When txTrafficDescType is 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9, parameter 5 reflects the equivalent cell rate in cell/s for this connection as determined by the Connection Admission Control (CAC) algorithm. The equivalent cell rate is useful in determining the admission characteristics of this connection."

The values of peak cell rate (PCR), sustained cell rate (SCR), minimum cell rate (MCR) are expressed in cell/s. Maximum burst size (MBS) is expressed in cells. Cell delay variation tolerance (CDVT) is expressed in microseconds. When rxTrafficDescType is 1 or 2, none of the parameters are used. When rxTrafficDescType is 3, parameter 1 represents the PCR for CLP equal to 0 and 1 traffic; parameter 4 represents the CDVT. When rxTrafficDescType is 4, parameter 1 represents the PCR for CLP equal to 0 and 1 traffic; parameter 2 represents the PCR for CLP equal to 0 traffic with cell discard; parameter 4 represents the CDVT. When rxTrafficDescType is 5, parameter 1 represents the PCR for CLP equal to 0 and 1 traffic; parameter 2 represents the PCR for CLP equal to 0 traffic with cell tagging; parameter 4 represents the CDVT. When rxTrafficDescType is 6, parameter 1 represents the PCR for CLP equal to 0 and 1 traffic; parameter 2 represents the SCR for CLP equal to 0 and 1 traffic; parameter 3 represents the MBS for CLP equal to 0 and 1 traffic; parameter 4 represents the CDVT. When rxTrafficDescType is 7, parameter 1 represents the PCR for CLP equal to 0 and 1 traffic; parameter 2 represents the SCR for CLP equal to 0 traffic with cell discard; parameter 3 represents the MBS for CLP equal to 0 traffic; parameter 4 represents the CDVT.

When rxTrafficDescType is 9, parameter 1 represents the PCR; parameter 2 represents CDVT; parameter 3 represents the MCR; parameter 4 indicates the instantaneous rate at which dynamic generic cell rate algorithm (DGCRA) is in effect. If upc is disabled for this connection, the values of PCR, SCR, MBS and CDVT are the provisioned parameters. If upc is enabled, the values of PCR, SCR, MBS, and CDVT are exactly the values used by the usage parameter control hardware in policing the arriving traffic. These may vary slightly from the provisioned values due to granularity of the hardware. In the case where the PCR is equal to the SCR, the effective MBS is zero."

The ACR is not allowed to fall below the Minimum Cell Rate (MCR), in which case the ACR is set to MCR. The value of CRM is obtained as transientBufferExposure divided by maxCellsPerRmCell."

Its value reflects whether the rate of received OAM cells for this connection is below a specified threshold. The connection maintains a count of the number of OAM cells which are terminated per second. Once that count exceeds the specified threshold, extraction of all OAM cells for this connection is disabled for a period of one minute. This is a congestion management mechanism to prevent the processor from being overloaded with handling OAM cells for a particular connection. This mechanism ensures that tasks, such as trunks obtain enough processor cycles to remain in service, and are not adversely affected by excessive rate of OAM cells on a particular connection. The value is good when the rate of received OAM cells is less than the allowed threshold. The value is bad when the arrival rate has exceeded the allowed threshold. It remains bad for one minute, before returning to good again. During this timeout, extraction of all OAM cells is disabled for this connection. As a result, other loopback failure conditions may occur. The value is unknown when the application has not yet begun to use this connection. An example is the Test component before a test has been started. Each type of OAM cell is counted separately. The threshold for AIS cells is three cells per second. If more than three AIS cells are received within a one second interval, this attribute is set to bad. The threshold for RDI cells and each loopback type is also three, but the threshold for trace cells is 250 per second.

The consistent availability of a fixed quantity of bandwidth is considered appropriate for CBR service. Cells which are delayed beyond the value specified by Cell Transfer Delay are assumed to have significantly reduced value of the application. The rtVariableBitRate service category is intended for real time applications; that is those requiring tightly constrained delay and delay variation, as would be appropriate for voice and video applications. Sources are expected to transmit at a rate which varies with time. Equivalently, the source can be described as 'bursty'. Cells which are delayed beyond the value specified by Cell Transfer Delay are assumed to be of significantly reduced value to the application. Real time VBR service may support statistical multiplexing of real time sources. The nrtVariableBitRate service category is intended for non-real time applications which have bursty traffic characteristics and which can be characterized in terms of a PCR, SCR, and MBS. For those cells which are transferred within the traffic contract, the application expects a low cell loss ratio. For all connections, it expects a bound on the mean cell transfer delay. Non-real time VBR service may support statistical multiplexing of connections. The unspecifiedBitRate service is intended for non-real time applications, that is those not requiring tightly constrained delay and delay variation. UBR sources are expected to be bursty. UBR service supports a high degree of statistical multiplexing among sources. UBR service does not specify traffic related service guarantees. No numerical commitments are made with respect to the cell loss ratio experienced by a UBR connection, or as to the cell transfer delay experienced by cells on the connection."

When the value of rxTrafficDescType 7 or 8, Enforcer 2 enforces conformance of traffic received from the interface to SCR CLP0. If UPC is enforced, enforcer 2 discards non-conforming cells for rxTrafficDescType values of 4, 6 and 7. It tags non-conforming cells for rxTrafficDescType values of 5 and 8. Discarded cells are counted in the rxCellDiscard attribute. For basic Vpts, this attribute provides an aggregated total of all rxUpcViolationOnEnforcer2 values for the Vccs associated with the Vpt.

A rate of zero (0) indicates that shaping is not performed. When txTrafficDescType is 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 or 8, parameter 5 reflects the equivalent cell rate in cell/s for this connection as determined by the Connection Admission Control (CAC) algorithm.

The value derivedFromBBC may only be used if the SrcPvc component is provisioned under this Vcc.Otherwise a specific ATM service category must be specified. If this attribute is set to derivedFromBBC, the Broadband Bearer Capability (BBC) and bestEffort attributes are used to determine the atmServiceCategory of this connection. If this attribute is set to other than derivedFromBBC, the value of this attribute is used to override the provisioned BBC Information Element parameters. In those cases, the BBC attributes are not used. The constantBitRate service category is intended for real time applications, that is those requiring tightly constrained delay and delay variation, as would be appropriate for voice and video applications. The consistent availability of a fixed quantity of bandwidth is considered appropriate for CBR service. Cells which are delayed beyond the value specified by Cell Transfer Delay are assumed to be of significantly reduce value to the application. The rtVariableBitRate service category is intended for real time applications, that is those requiring tightly constrained delay and delay variation, as would be appropriate for voice and video applications. Sources are expected to transmit at a rate which varies with time. Equivalently, the source can be described as 'bursty'. Cells which are delayed beyond the value specified by CTD are assumed to be of significantly reduced value to the application. Real time VBR service may support statistical multiplexing of real time sources. The nrtVariableBitRate service category is intended for non-real time applications which have bursty traffic characteristics and which can be characterized in terms of a PCR, SCR, and MBS. For those cells which are transferred within the traffic contract, the application expects a low cell loss ratio. For all connections, it expects a bound on the mean cell transfer delay. Non-real time VBR service may support statistical multiplexing of connections. The unspecifiedBitRate service is intended for non-real time applications; that is, those not requiring tightly constrained delay and delay variation. UBR sources are expected to be bursty. UBR service supports a high degree of statistical multiplexing among sources. UBR service does not specify traffic related service guarantees. No numerical commitments are made with respect to the cell loss ratio experienced by a UBR connection, or as to the cell transfer delay experienced by cells on the connection."

    "description": "This attribute is migrated to the AtmTmProv group. This attribute is a vector of five traffic parameters whose meanings are defined by the txTrafficDescType attribute. The values of peak cell rate (PCR), sustained cell rate (SCR) and requested shaping rate are expressed in cell/s. Maximum burst size (MBS) is expressed in cells. CDVT is expressed in microseconds. The values of PCR, SCR, MBS and CDVT are used for connection admission control (CAC). The value of CDVT is only used for connections where the atmServiceCategory is constantBitRate. For all other values of atmServiceCategory, CDVT is ignored. The values of PCR, SCR and requested shaping rate are used to determine the actual shaping rate where traffic shaping is enabled. When txTrafficDescType is 1 or 2, all of the parameters must be set to zero. When txTrafficDescType is 3, parameter 1 represents the PCR for CLP equal to 0 and 1 traffic; parameter 4 represents the CDVT; and parameter 5 represents the requested shaping rate. A non-zero value in parameter 5 overrides any value in parameter 1. This result is used as the PCR. Parameter 1 must be non-zero. Parameters 2 and 3 must be zero. When txTrafficDescType is 4, parameter 1 represents the PCR for CLP equal to 0 and 1 traffic with cell discard; parameter 2 represents the PCR for CLP equal to 0 traffic; parameter 4 represents the CDVT; and parameter 5 represents the requested shaping rate. A non-zero value in parameter 5 overrides any value in parameter 1. This result is used as the PCR. Parameter 1 must be greater than or equal to parameter 2. Parameters 1 and 2 must be non-zero. Parameter 3 must be zero. When txTrafficDescType is 5, parameter 1 represents the PCR for CLP equal to 0 and 1 traffic with cell tagging; parameter 2 represents the PCR for CLP equal to 0 traffic; parameter 4 represents the CDVT; and parameter 5 represents the requested shaping rate. A non-zero value in parameter 5 overrides any value in parameter 1. This result is used as the PCR. Parameter 1 must be greater than or equal to parameter 2. Parameters 1 and 2 must be non-zero. Parameter 3 must be zero. When txTrafficDescType is 6, parameter 1 represents the PCR for CLP equal to 0 and 1 traffic; parameter 2 represents the SCR for CLP equal to 0 and 1 traffic; parameter 3 represents the MBS for CLP equal to 0 and 1 traffic; parameter 4 represents the CDVT; and parameter 5 represents the requested shaping rate. A non-zero value in parameter 5 overrides any value in parameter 1. This result is used as the PCR. Parameters 1, 2 and 3 must be non-zero. Parameter 1 must be greater than or equal to parameter 2. Parameter 5, must either be zero (unused) or greater than or equal to parameter 2. When txTrafficDescType is 7, parameter 1 represents the PCR for CLP equal to 0 and 1 traffic; parameter 2 represents the SCR for CLP equal to 0 with cell discard; parameter 3 represents the MBS for CLP equal to 0 traffic; parameter 4 represents the CDVT; and parameter 5 represents the requested shaping rate. A non-zero value in parameter 5 overrides any value in parameter 1. This result is used as the PCR. Parameters 1, 2 and 3 must be non-zero. Parameter 1 must be greater than or equal to parameter 2. Parameter 5, must either be zero (unused) or greater than or equal to parameter 2. When txTrafficDescType is 8, parameter 1 represents the PCR for CLP equal to 0 and 1 traffic; parameter 2 represents the SCR for CLP equal to 0 traffic with cell tagging; parameter 3 represents the MBS for CLP equal to 0 traffic; parameter 4 represents the CDVT; and parameter 5 represents the requested shaping rate. A non-zero value in parameter 5 overrides any value in parameter 1. This result is used as the PCR. Parameters 1, 2 and 3 must be non-zero. Parameter 1 must be greater than or equal to parameter 2. Parameter 5, must either be zero (unused) or greater than or equal to parameter 2. Whenever it is valid for PCR to be specified, parameter 5 may also be used to specify a requested shaping rate. A non-zero value in parameter 5 overrides the value in parameter 1 and is used as the peak cell rate in calculations of CAC and shaping rate. For txTrafficDescType 3, 4 and 5, the transmit traffic is shaped at the next rate less than the PCR. For txTrafficDescType 6, 7 and 8, the transmit traffic is shaped at the highest available rate which is between PCR and SCR. However, if there is no available shaping rate between PCR and SCR, traffic is shaped at the next rate above the PCR."

    "description": "This attribute is migrated to the AtmTmProv group. This attribute is a vector of four traffic parameters whose meanings are defined by the rxTrafficDescType attribute. The values of peak cell rate (PCR) and sustained cell rate (SCR) are expressed in cell/s. Maximum burst size (MBS) is expressed in cells. The value of CDVT is expressed in microseconds. The values of PCR, SCR, MBS and CDVT are used for usage parameter control (UPC). When rxTrafficDescType is 1 or 2, all of the parameters must be set to zero (unused). When rxTrafficDescType is 3, parameter 1 represents the PCR for CLP equal to 0 and 1 traffic. Parameter 1 must be non-zero. Parameters 2 and 3 must be set to zero (unused). When rxTrafficDescType is 4, parameter 1 represents the PCR for CLP equal to 0 and 1 traffic; parameter 2 represents the PCR for CLP equal to 0 traffic with cell discard. Parameters 1 and 2 must be non-zero. Parameter 3 must be set to zero (unused). Parameter 1 must be greater than or equal to parameter 2. When rxTrafficDescType is 5, parameter 1 represents the PCR for CLP equal to 0 and 1 traffic; parameter 2 represents the PCR for CLP equal to 0 traffic with cell tagging. Parameters 1 and 2 must be non-zero. Parameter 3 must be set to zero (unused). Parameter 1 must be greater than or equal to parameter 2. When rxTrafficDescType is a 6, parameter 1 represents the PCR for CLP equal to 0 and 1 traffic; parameter 2 represents the SCR for CLP equal to 0 and 1 traffic; parameter 3 represents the MBS for CLP equal to 0 and 1 traffic.

When rxTrafficDescType is 7, parameter 1 represents the PCR for CLP equal to 0 and 1 traffic; parameter 2 represents the SCR for CLP equal to 0 traffic with cell discard; parameter 3 represents the MBS for CLP equal to 0 traffic. Parameters 1, 2 and 3 must be non- zero. Parameter 1 must be greater than or equal to parameter 2. When rxTrafficDescType is 8, parameter 1 represents the PCR for CLP equal to 0 and 1 traffic; parameter 2 represents the SCR for CLP equal to 0 traffic with cell tagging; parameter 3 represents the MBS for CLP equal to 0 traffic. Parameter 1, 2 and 3 must be non- zero. Parameter 1 must be greater than or equal to parameter 2. When rxTrafficDescType is any value from 3 through 8, parameter 4 represents the CDVT. If this value is zero, the CDVT is taken from the ConnectionAdministrator defaults for the particular atmServiceCategory of this connection. When rxTrafficDescriptorType is 3 through 8, there are certain extreme combinations of rxTrafficDescParm which are outside the capabilities of the UPC hardware. The check prov command detects such cases and generates an error message. If this happens, adjust the parameters until they fall within the supported limits. To calculate the limits, use the following formulae: I1 = 1 000 000 000 / PCR L1 = CDVT * 1000 I2 = 1 000 000 000 / SCR L2 = CDVT + (MBS - 1) * (I2 - I1) I1 and I2 must be less than or equal to 335 523 840. I1 + L1 must be less than or equal to 1 342 156 800. I2 + L2 must be less than or equal to 1 342 156 800. Note that I2 and L2 only apply when the rxTrafficDescriptorType is 6 through 8. If the values of I1, L1, I2 or L2 are closer to the limits described above, a further restriction applies. Specifically, if either: I1 > 41 940 480 or I2 > 41 940 480 or I1 + L1 > 167 769 600 or I2 + L2 > 167 769 600 then both I1 and I2 must be greater than 20 480. Parameter 5 of the rxTrafficDescParm is always unused. If the rxTrafficDescType is sameAsTx, the values in this attribute are taken from the txTrafficDescParm."

The value derivedFromBBC may only be used if the SrcPvc component is provisioned under this Vcc. Otherwise a specific ATM service category must be specified. If this attribute is set to derivedFromBBC, the Broadband Bearer Capability (BBC) and bestEffort attributes are used to determine the atmServiceCategory of this connection. If this attribute is set to other than derivedFromBBC, the value of this attribute is used to override the provisioned BBC Information Element parameters. In those cases, the BBC attributes are not used. The constantBitRate service category is intended for real time applications, that is those requiring tightly constrained delay and delay variation, as would be appropriate for voice and video applications. The consistent availability of a fixed quantity of bandwidth is considered appropriate for CBR service. Cells which are delayed beyond the value specified by Cell Transfer Delay are assumed to be of significantly reduced value to the application. The rtVariableBitRate service category is intended for real time applications, that is those requiring tightly constrained delay and delay variation, as would be appropriate for voice and video applications. Sources are expected to transmit at a rate which varies with time. Equivalently, the source can be described as 'bursty'. Cells which are delayed beyond the value specified by CTD are assumed to be of significantly reduced value to the application. Real time VBR service may support statistical multiplexing of real time sources. The nrtVariableBitRate service category is intended for non-real time applications which have bursty traffic characteristics and which can be characterized in terms of a PCR, SCR, and MBS. For those cells which are transferred within the traffic contract, the application expects a low cell loss ratio. For all connections, it expects a bound on the mean cell transfer delay. Non-real time VBR service may support statistical multiplexing of connections. The availableBitRate service is an ATM layer service category for which the limiting ATM layer transfer characteristics provided by the network may change subsequent to connection establishment. ABR service has a flow control mechanism which supports several types of feedback to control the source rate in response to changing ATM layer transfer characteristics. ABR service is not intended to support real-time applications. The unspecifiedBitRate service is intended for non-real time applications; that is, those not requiring tightly constrained delay and delay variation. UBR sources are expected to be bursty. UBR service supports a high degree of statistical multiplexing among sources. UBR service does not specify traffic related service guarantees. No numerical commitments are made with respect to the cell loss ratio experienced by a UBR connection, or as to the cell transfer delay experienced by cells on the connection."

Packet-wise discard functions should only be requested if this connection is transferring AAL5 frame traffic. This attribute is not applicable for Vpts. Packet-wise functions increase the 'goodput' of the link. The transmit packet-wise functions are Early Packet Discard (EPD) and Partial Packet Discard (PPD). EPD allows the connection to discard an entire frame once the transmit queue has reached the EPD threshold. EPD increases the 'goodput' of a link, since discarding an entire frame means that some queue capacity is guarded for some other frame which is already partially transmitted. All cells of the frame are discarded from the Beginning of Message (BOM) cell up to and including the End of Message (EOM) cell. PPD allows the connection to discard the remainder of a cell- forwarded AAL5 frame if one cell of this frame has been discarded. All cells are discarded up to but not including the EOM cell. The PPD function increases the 'goodput' of the link, since cells which are only going to be discarded at the AAL5 reassembly point are not transmitted. On CQC-based ATM cards, the packet-wise discard functions are PPD and EPD. PPD is available at VCC cell-transfer points. PPD is not applicable at frame-cell conversion points, and is not applicable for Vpcs. PPD is configured by this attribute. Packet-wise discard should only be enabled for connections carrying AAL5 segmentation traffic. Setting the value to enabled for any other traffic type may result in all traffic being discarded. On CQC-based ATM FPs, EPD is automatically enabled at frame-to-cell conversion points, independent of the setting of this attribute. On ATM IP cards, packet-wise discard functions include EPD and PPD. PPD and EPD apply to individual VCCs and VCCs within VPCs at all connection points, including tandem VPC connections. Both PPD and EPD are controlled by this attribute. This attribute may safely be set to enabled for any connection (Vcc or Vpc) on ATM IP FPs since they have the ability to automatically detect AAL5-segmented traffic on a connection, and only enable packet- wise discards if AAL5-segmented traffic is detected. When this attribute is set to enabled, packet-wise discard functions are applied to transmit traffic at this connection point. When this attribute is set to disabled, packet-wise discard functions are not applied to transmit traffic at this connection point.

A non-zero value in parameter 5 overrides any value in parameter 1. This result is used as the PCR. Parameters 1, 2 and 3 must be non-zero. Parameter 1 must be greater than or equal to parameter 2. Parameter 5, must either be zero (unused) or greater than or equal to parameter 2. When txTrafficDescType is 7, parameter 1 represents the PCR for CLP equal to 0 and 1 traffic; parameter 2 represents the SCR for CLP equal to 0 with cell discard; parameter 3 represents the MBS for CLP equal to 0 traffic; parameter 4 represents the CDVT; and parameter 5 represents the requested shaping rate. A non-zero value in parameter 5 overrides any value in parameter 1. This result is used as the PCR. Parameters 1, 2 and 3 must be non-zero. Parameter 1 must be greater than or equal to parameter 2. Parameter 5, must either be zero (unused) or greater than or equal to parameter 2. When txTrafficDescType is 8, parameter 1 represents the PCR for CLP equal to 0 and 1 traffic; parameter 2 represents the SCR for CLP equal to 0 traffic with cell tagging; parameter 3 represents the MBS for CLP equal to 0 traffic; parameter 4 represents the CDVT; and parameter 5 represents the requested shaping rate. A non-zero value in parameter 5 overrides any value in parameter 1. This result is used as the PCR. Parameters 1, 2 and 3 must be non-zero. Parameter 1 must be greater than or equal to parameter 2. Parameter 5, must either be zero (unused) or greater than or equal to parameter 2. When txTrafficDescType is 9, parameter 1 represents the PCR; parameter 2 represents the CDVT; parameter 3 represents the MCR; parameter 4 and parameter 5 represent are not used and must be zero. Parameter 1 must be non-zero and must be greater than or equal to parameter 3. Parameter 3 may be optionally zero. Whenever it is valid for PCR to be specified, parameter 5 may also be used to specify a requested shaping rate. A non-zero value in parameter 5 overrides the value in parameter 1 and is used as the peak cell rate in calculations of CAC and shaping rate. When the atmServiceCategory is availableBitRate (ABR), the shaping rate is dynamically chosen, based on the ABR flow control mechanism, as a value between the MCR and the PCR or the requested shaping rate if applicable. For txTrafficDescType 3, 4 and 5, the transmit traffic is shaped at the next available shaping rate less than the PCR. For txTrafficDescType 6, 7 and 8 if linear traffic shaping is selected, the transmit traffic is shaped at the highest available rate which is between PCR and SCR. However, if there is no available shaping rate between PCR and SCR, traffic is shaped at the next rate above the PCR. For txTrafficDescType 6, 7 and 8 if inverse-UPC traffic shaping is selected, the transmit traffic is shaped at a variable rate which conforms to the PCR, SCR and MBS of the connection traffic descriptor. Inverse-UPC traffic shaping is available only on ATM IP cards."

    "description": "This attribute is a vector of four traffic parameters whose meanings are defined by the rxTrafficDescType attribute. The values of peak cell rate (PCR), sustained cell rate (SCR) and Minimum Cell Rate (MCR) are expressed in cell/s. Maximum burst size (MBS) is expressed in cells. The value of CDVT is expressed in microseconds. The values of PCR, SCR, MCR, MBS and CDVT are used for usage parameter control (UPC). When rxTrafficDescType is 1 or 2, all of the parameters must be set to zero (unused). When rxTrafficDescType is 3, parameter 1 represents the PCR for CLP equal to 0 and 1 traffic. Parameter 1 must be non-zero. Parameters 2 and 3 must be set to zero (unused). When rxTrafficDescType is 4, parameter 1 represents the PCR for CLP equal to 0 and 1 traffic; parameter 2 represents the PCR for CLP equal to 0 traffic with cell discard. Parameters 1 and 2 must be non-zero. Parameter 3 must be set to zero (unused). Parameter 1 must be greater than or equal to parameter 2. When rxTrafficDescType is 5, parameter 1 represents the PCR for CLP equal to 0 and 1 traffic; parameter 2 represents the PCR for CLP equal to 0 traffic with cell tagging. Parameters 1 and 2 must be non-zero. Parameter 3 must be set to zero (unused). Parameter 1 must be greater than or equal to parameter 2. When rxTrafficDescType is a 6, parameter 1 represents the PCR for CLP equal to 0 and 1 traffic; parameter 2 represents the SCR for CLP equal to 0 and 1 traffic; parameter 3 represents the MBS for CLP equal to 0 and 1 traffic. Parameters 1, 2 and 3 must be non- zero. Parameter 1 must be greater than or equal to Parameter 2. When rxTrafficDescType is 7, parameter 1 represents the PCR for CLP equal to 0 and 1 traffic; parameter 2 represents the SCR for CLP equal to 0 traffic with cell discard; parameter 3 represents the MBS for CLP equal to 0 traffic. Parameters 1, 2 and 3 must be non- zero. Parameter 1 must be greater than or equal to parameter 2. When rxTrafficDescType is 8, parameter 1 represents the PCR for CLP equal to 0 and 1 traffic; parameter 2 represents the SCR for CLP equal to 0 traffic with cell tagging; parameter 3 represents the MBS for CLP equal to 0 traffic. Parameter 1, 2 and 3 must be non- zero. Parameter 1 must be greater than or equal to parameter 2. When rxTrafficDescType is 9, parameter 1 represents the PCR; parameter 2 represents the CDVT; parameter 3 represents the MCR. Parameter 4 is not used and must be zero. Parameter 1,must be non- zero and must be greater than or equal to parameter 3. Parameter 3 may optionally be zero. When rxTrafficDescType is any value from 3 through 8, parameter 4 represents the CDVT. If the value of CDVT either in parameter 2 or in parameter 4 is zero, the CDVT is taken from the CA defaults for the particular atmServiceCategory of this connection. On a CQC-based ATM card, when rxTrafficDescriptorType is 3 through 8, there are certain extreme combinations of rxTrafficDescParm which are outside the capabilities of the UPC hardware. The check prov command detects such cases and generates an error message. If this happens, adjust the parameters until they fall within the supported limits. To calculate the limits, use the following formulae: I1 = 1 000 000 000 / PCR L1 = CDVT * 1000 I2 = 1,000,000,000 / SCR L2 = CDVT + (MBS - 1) * (I2 - I1) I1 and I2 must be less than or equal to 335,523,840. I1 + L1 must be less than or equal to 1,342,156,800. I2 + L2 must be less than or equal to 1,342,156,800. Note that I2 and L2 only apply when the rxTrafficDescriptorType is 6 through 8. If the values of I1, L1, I2 or L2 are closer to the limits described above, a further restriction applies. Specifically, if either: I1 > 41,940,480 or I2 > 41,940,480 or I1 + L1 > 167,769,600 or I2 + L2 > 167,769,600 then both I1 and I2 must be greater than 20,480. Parameter 5 of the rxTrafficDescParm is always unused. If the rxTrafficDescType is sameAsTx, the values provisioned in this attribute are ignored. The traffic parameters for the receive direction are taken from the txTrafficDescParm."

CDF controls the decrease in the Allowed Cell Rate (ACR) associated with the CRM parameter, the limit of the number of forward Resource Management (RM) cells which may be sent in the absence of received backward RM cells. When this limit is crossed, the ACR value would be decreased by the amount (CDF*ACR). The ACR is not allowed to fall below the Minimum Cell Rate (MCR), in which case the ACR is set to MCR. The value of CRM is indicated by the forwardRmCellLimit attribute. This attribute is ignored under all conditions where the operational attribute abrConnectionType indicates erSwitch or efciSwitch.

This attribute does not apply to Virtual Link VPTs and will always be displayed as constantBitRate. The constantBitRate service category is intended for real time applications, that is, those requiring tightly constrained delay and delay variation, as would be appropriate for voice and video applications. The consistent availability of a fixed quantity of bandwidth is considered appropriate for CBR service. Cells which are delayed beyond the value specified by Cell Transfer Delay are assumed to have significantly reduced value for the application. The rtVariableBitRate service category is intended for real time applications; that is those requiring tightly constrained delay and delay variation, as would be appropriate for voice and video applications. Sources are expected to transmit at a rate which varies with time. Equivalently, the source can be described as 'bursty'. Cells which are delayed beyond the value specified by Cell Transfer Delay are assumed to be of significantly reduced value to the application. Real time VBR service may support statistical multiplexing of real time sources. The nrtVariableBitRate service category is intended for non-real time applications which have bursty traffic characteristics and which can be characterized in terms of a PCR, SCR, and MBS. For those cells which are transferred within the traffic contract, the application expects a low cell loss ratio. For all connections, it expects a bound on the mean cell transfer delay. Non-real time VBR service may support statistical multiplexing of connections. The availableBitRate service is an ATM layer service category for which the limiting ATM layer transfer characteristics provided by the network may change subsequent to connection establishment. ABR service has a flow control mechanism which supports several types of feedback to control the source rate in response to changing ATM layer transfer characteristics. ABR service is not intended to support real-time applications. The unspecifiedBitRate service is intended for non-real time applications, that is those not requiring tightly constrained delay and delay variation. UBR sources are expected to be bursty. UBR service supports a high degree of statistical multiplexing among sources. UBR service does not specify traffic related service guarantees. No numerical commitments are made with respect to the cell loss ratio experienced by a UBR connection, or as to the cell transfer delay experienced by cells on the connection."

The values of peak cell rate (PCR), sustained cell rate (SCR), Minimum Cell Rate (MCR), actual cell rate (ACR), explicit rate (ER), equivalent cell rate (ECR), and actual shaping rate are expressed in cell/s. Maximum burst size (MBS) is expressed in cells. CDVT is expressed in microseconds. When txTrafficDescType is 1 or 2, parameters 1 through 5 are unused. In this description, PCR is the greater of either the PCR or the requested shaping rate (parameter 1 or parameter 5) specified in the txTrafficDescParm attribute under the Vcd Tm or Vpd Tm component. When txTrafficDescType is 3, parameter 1 represents the PCR for CLP equal to 0 or 1 traffic; parameters 2 and 3 are unused. When txTrafficDescType is 4, parameter 1 represents the PCR for CLP equal to 0 and 1 traffic; parameter 2 represents the PCR for CLP equal to 0 traffic with cell discard. When txTrafficDescType is 5, parameter 1 represents the PCR for CLP equal to 0 and 1 traffic; parameter 2 represents the PCR for CLP equal to 0 traffic with cell tagging. When txTrafficDescType is 6, parameter 1 represents the PCR for CLP equal to 0 and 1 traffic; parameter 2 represents the SCR for CLP equal to 0 and 1 traffic; parameter 3 represents the MBS for CLP equal to 0 and 1 traffic. When txTrafficDescType is 7, parameter 1 represents the PCR for CLP equal to 0 and 1 traffic; parameter 2 represents the SCR for CLP equal to 0 traffic with cell discard; parameter 3 represents the MBS for CLP equal to 0 traffic. When txTrafficDescType is 8, parameter 1 represents the PCR for CLP equal to 0 and 1 traffic; parameter 2 represents the SCR for CLP equal to 0 traffic with cell tagging; parameter 3 represents the MBS for CLP equal to 0 traffic. When txTrafficDescType is 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8, parameter 4 reflects the actual shaping rate in cell/s for this connection. For CQC-based ATM cards, the set of available shaping rates is based on the number of interfaces doing shaping (attribute perVcQueueInterfaces), and the shapingScalingFactor attribute of the Arc Cqc Override component. A rate of zero (0) indicates that shaping is not performed, or that the interface is down. When txTrafficDescType is 9, parameter 1 represents the PCR; parameter 2 represents the Cell Delay Variation Toleration (CDVT); parameter 3 represents the Minimum Cell Rate (MCR); the meaning of parameter 4 depends upon the value of the abrConnectionType attribute. if abrConnectionType is sourceDest or virtualSourceDest, parameter 4 represents the Allowed Cell Rate (ACR); If abrConnectionType is erSwitch, parameter 4 represents the Explicit Rate (ER); and if abrConnectionType is efciSwitch, parameter 4 reflects the actual shaping rate in cell/s for this connection. When txTrafficDescType is 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9, parameter 5 reflects the equivalent cell rate in cell/s for this connection as determined by the Connection Admission Control (CAC) algorithm.

The values of peak cell rate (PCR), sustained cell rate (SCR), minimum cell rate (MCR) are expressed in cell/s. Maximum burst size (MBS) is expressed in cells. Cell delay variation tolerance (CDVT) is expressed in microseconds. When rxTrafficDescType is 1 or 2, none of the parameters are used. When rxTrafficDescType is 3, parameter 1 represents the PCR for CLP equal to 0 and 1 traffic; parameter 4 represents the CDVT. When rxTrafficDescType is 4, parameter 1 represents the PCR for CLP equal to 0 and 1 traffic; parameter 2 represents the PCR for CLP equal to 0 traffic with cell discard; parameter 4 represents the CDVT. When rxTrafficDescType is 5, parameter 1 represents the PCR for CLP equal to 0 and 1 traffic; parameter 2 represents the PCR for CLP equal to 0 traffic with cell tagging; parameter 4 represents the CDVT. When rxTrafficDescType is 6, parameter 1 represents the PCR for CLP equal to 0 and 1 traffic; parameter 2 represents the SCR for CLP equal to 0 and 1 traffic; parameter 3 represents the MBS for CLP equal to 0 and 1 traffic; parameter 4 represents the CDVT. When rxTrafficDescType is 7, parameter 1 represents the PCR for CLP equal to 0 and 1 traffic; parameter 2 represents the SCR for CLP equal to 0 traffic with cell discard; parameter 3 represents the MBS for CLP equal to 0 traffic; parameter 4 represents the CDVT. When rxTrafficDescType is 8, parameter 1 represents the PCR for CLP equal to 0 and 1 traffic; parameter 2 represents the SCR for CLP equal to 0 traffic with cell tagging; parameter 3 represents the MBS for CLP equal to 0 traffic; parameter 4 represents the CDVT. When rxTrafficDescType is 9, parameter 1 represents the PCR; parameter 2 represents CDVT; parameter 3 represents the MCR; parameter 4 indicates the instantaneous rate at which dynamic generic cell rate algorithm (DGCRA) is in effect. If upc is disabled for this connection, the values of PCR, SCR, MBS and CDVT are the provisioned parameters. If upc is enabled, the values of PCR, SCR, MBS, and CDVT are exactly the values used by the usage parameter control hardware in policing the arriving traffic. These may vary slightly from the provisioned values due to granularity of the hardware. In the case where the PCR is equal to the SCR, the effective MBS is zero."

Its value reflects whether the rate of received OAM cells for this connection is below a specified threshold. The connection maintains a count of the number of OAM cells which are terminated per second. Once that count exceeds the specified threshold, extraction of all OAM cells for this connection is disabled for a period of one minute. This is a congestion management mechanism to prevent the processor from being overloaded with handling OAM cells for a particular connection. This mechanism ensures that tasks, such as trunks obtain enough processor cycles to remain in service, and are not adversely affected by excessive rate of OAM cells on a particular connection. The value is good when the rate of received OAM cells is less than the allowed threshold. The value is bad when the arrival rate has exceeded the allowed threshold. It remains bad for one minute, before returning to good again. During this timeout, extraction of all OAM cells is disabled for this connection. As a result, other loopback failure conditions may occur. The value is unknown when the application has not yet begun to use this connection. An example is the Test component before a test has been started. Each type of OAM cell is counted separately. The threshold for AIS cells is three cells per second. If more than three AIS cells are received within a one second interval, this attribute is set to bad. The threshold for RDI cells and each loopback type is also three, but the threshold for trace cells is 250 per second.

This attribute indicates the ATM service category used for traffic in both directions of the connection. The constantBitRate service category is intended for real time applications, that is, those requiring tightly constrained delay and delay variation, as would be appropriate for voice and video applications. The consistent availability of a fixed quantity of bandwidth is considered appropriate for CBR service. Cells which are delayed beyond the value specified by Cell Transfer Delay are assumed to have significantly reduced value of the application. The rtVariableBitRate service category is intended for real time applications; that is those requiring tightly constrained delay and delay variation, as would be appropriate for voice and video applications. Sources are expected to transmit at a rate which varies with time. Equivalently, the source can be described as 'bursty'. Cells which are delayed beyond the value specified by Cell Transfer Delay are assumed to be of significantly reduced value to the application. Real time VBR service may support statistical multiplexing of real time sources. The nrtVariableBitRate service category is intended for non-real time applications which have bursty traffic characteristics and which can be characterized in terms of a PCR, SCR, and MBS. For those cells which are transferred within the traffic contract, the application expects a low cell loss ratio. For all connections, it expects a bound on the mean cell transfer delay. Non-real time VBR service may support statistical multiplexing of connections. The unspecifiedBitRate service is intended for non-real time applications, that is those not requiring tightly constrained delay and delay variation. UBR sources are expected to be bursty. UBR service supports a high degree of statistical multiplexing among sources. UBR service does not specify traffic related service guarantees. No numerical commitments are made with respect to the cell loss ratio experienced by a UBR connection, or as to the cell transfer delay experienced by cells on the connection."

PPD is controlled by provisioning for PVCs and SPVCs, and by call setup parameters in the AAL and Traffic Descriptor Information Elements. A value of epd indicates that the Early Packet Discard (EPD) function is in effect at this connection endpoint. PPD and EPD are enabled by default at a connection endpoint which is performing AAL5 segmentation and assembly. Frame discard functions are not applicable for Virtual Path Connections (VPCs).

    "description": "This attribute specifies the activation of frame discard functionality in the backward data direction, at relay points, for this connection. It applies to each hop of the connection. Frame discard functions should not be requested if this connection is not transferring frame (AAL5) traffic. Setting the value to indicated for any other traffic type results in all traffic being discarded. If this connection point is a permanent (provisioned) VCC mid- point, this attribute specifies whether the Partial Packet Discard (PPD) function is to be enabled or disabled in the receive direction at this connecting point. The PPD function allows the connecting point to discard the remainder of a cell-forwarded AAL5 frame if one cell of this frame has been discarded. The PPD function increases the 'goodput' of the link, since cells which are only going to be discarded by the AAL5 reassembly are not received. At a permanent VCC connecting point which is not a connection endpoint, when this attribute is set to indicated, the PPD function is applied to receive traffic at this connecting point. It should not be indicated for connections whose end points are not performing AAL5 segmentation and reassembly. When this attribute is set to notIndicated, the PPD feature is not applied to receive traffic at this connecting point. At a SPVC origin on a PNNI interface, a value of indicated specifies that frame discard is requested in the backward direction. The frame discard function for SPVCs consists of PPD at the SPVC origin and at all intermediate connecting points. When this attribute is set to notIndicated, backwards frame discard is not requested in the SPVC call setup. Thus PPD is not enabled at the SPVC origin nor at any intermediate connecting point. At all points along a VPC, this setting is ignored. At a permanent VCC connection endpoint, this value is ignored. If AAL5 segmentation and reassembly has been requested, PPD and Early Packet Discard (EPD) are automatically enabled. This attribute has been migrated to rxFrameDiscard."

A value of standard configures two levels of TM for the VPT, one level for VP TM and one level for VC level TM. VCs within the VP use weighted fair queueing (standard VPT VCC scheduling) to schedule VCs within the VPT, with VCs differentiated as either real-time (CBR, rt-VBR) or non-real-time (nrt-VBR, UBR) connections.

The values of peak cell rate (PCR), sustained cell rate (SCR) and requested shaping rate are expressed in cell/s. Maximum burst size (MBS) is expressed in cells. CDVT is expressed in microseconds. The values of PCR, SCR, MBS and CDVT are used for connection admission control (CAC). The value of CDVT is only used for connections where the atmServiceCategory is constantBitRate. For all other values of atmServiceCategory, CDVT is ignored. The values of PCR, SCR and requested shaping rate are used to determine the actual shaping rate where traffic shaping is enabled. When txTrafficDescType is 1 or 2, all of the parameters must be set to zero. When txTrafficDescType is 3, parameter 1 represents the PCR for CLP equal to 0 and 1 traffic; parameter 4 represents the CDVT; and parameter 5 represents the requested shaping rate.

Parameter 5, must either be zero (unused) or greater than or equal to parameter 2. Whenever it is valid for PCR to be specified, parameter 5 may also be used to specify a requested shaping rate. A non-zero value in parameter 5 overrides the value in parameter 1 and is used as the peak cell rate in calculations of CAC and shaping rate. For txTrafficDescType 3, 4 and 5, the transmit traffic is shaped at the next rate less than the PCR. For txTrafficDescType 6, 7 and 8, the transmit traffic is shaped at the highest available rate which is between PCR and SCR. However, if there is no available shaping rate between PCR and SCR, traffic is shaped at the next rate above the PCR."

When rxTrafficDescType is 8, parameter 1 represents the PCR for CLP equal to 0 and 1 traffic; parameter 2 represents the SCR for CLP equal to 0 traffic with cell tagging; parameter 3 represents the MBS for CLP equal to 0 traffic. Parameter 1, 2 and 3 must be non- zero. Parameter 1 must be greater than or equal to parameter 2. When rxTrafficDescType is any value from 3 through 8, parameter 4 represents the CDVT. If this value is zero, the CDVT is taken from the ConnectionAdministrator defaults for the particular atmServiceCategory of this connection. When rxTrafficDescriptorType is 3 through 8, there are certain extreme combinations of rxTrafficDescParm which are outside the capabilities of the UPC hardware. The check prov command detects such cases and generates an error message. If this happens, adjust the parameters until they fall within the supported limits. To calculate the limits, use the following formulae: I1 = 1 000 000 000 / PCR L1 = CDVT * 1000 I2 = 1 000 000 000 / SCR L2 = CDVT + (MBS - 1) * (I2 - I1) I1 and I2 must be less than or equal to 335 523 840. I1 + L1 must be less than or equal to 1 342 156 800. I2 + L2 must be less than or equal to 1 342 156 800. Note that I2 and L2 only apply when the rxTrafficDescriptorType is 6 through 8. If the values of I1, L1, I2 or L2 are closer to the limits described above, a further restriction applies. Specifically, if either: I1 > 41 940 480 or I2 > 41 940 480 or I1 + L1 > 167 769 600 or I2 + L2 > 167 769 600 then both I1 and I2 must be greater than 20 480. Parameter 5 of the rxTrafficDescParm is always unused. If the rxTrafficDescType is sameAsTx, the values in this attribute are taken from the txTrafficDescParm."

    "description": "This attribute specifies the ATM service category for both directions of the connection. The value derivedFromBBC may only be used if the SrcPvc component is provisioned under this Vcc. Otherwise a specific ATM service category must be specified. If this attribute is set to derivedFromBBC, the Broadband Bearer Capability (BBC) and bestEffort attributes are used to determine the atmServiceCategory of this connection. If this attribute is set to other than derivedFromBBC, the value of this attribute is used to override the provisioned BBC Information Element parameters. In those cases, the BBC attributes are not used. The constantBitRate service category is intended for real time applications, that is those requiring tightly constrained delay and delay variation, as would be appropriate for voice and video applications. The consistent availability of a fixed quantity of bandwidth is considered appropriate for CBR service. Cells which are delayed beyond the value specified by Cell Transfer Delay are assumed to be of significantly reduced value to the application. The rtVariableBitRate service category is intended for real time applications, that is those requiring tightly constrained delay and delay variation, as would be appropriate for voice and video applications. Sources are expected to transmit at a rate which varies with time. Equivalently, the source can be described as 'bursty'. Cells which are delayed beyond the value specified by CTD are assumed to be of significantly reduced value to the application. Real time VBR service may support statistical multiplexing of real time sources. The nrtVariableBitRate service category is intended for non-real time applications which have bursty traffic characteristics and which can be characterized in terms of a PCR, SCR, and MBS. For those cells which are transferred within the traffic contract, the application expects a low cell loss ratio. For all connections, it expects a bound on the mean cell transfer delay. Non-real time VBR service may support statistical multiplexing of connections. The availableBitRate service is an ATM layer service category for which the limiting ATM layer transfer characteristics provided by the network may change subsequent to connection establishment. ABR service has a flow control mechanism which supports several types of feedback to control the source rate in response to changing ATM layer transfer characteristics. ABR service is not intended to support real-time applications. The unspecifiedBitRate service is intended for non-real time applications; that is, those not requiring tightly constrained delay and delay variation. UBR sources are expected to be bursty. UBR service supports a high degree of statistical multiplexing among sources. UBR service does not specify traffic related service guarantees. No numerical commitments are made with respect to the cell loss ratio experienced by a UBR connection, or as to the cell transfer delay experienced by cells on the connection."

Packet-wise discard functions should only be requested if this connection is transferring AAL5 frame traffic. This attribute is not applicable for Vpts. Packet-wise functions increase the 'goodput' of the link. The transmit packet-wise functions are Early Packet Discard (EPD) and Partial Packet Discard (PPD). EPD allows the connection to discard an entire frame once the transmit queue has reached the EPD threshold. EPD increases the 'goodput' of a link, since discarding an entire frame means that some queue capacity is guarded for some other frame which is already partially transmitted. All cells of the frame are discarded from the Beginning of Message (BOM) cell up to and including the End of Message (EOM) cell. PPD allows the connection to discard the remainder of a cell- forwarded AAL5 frame if one cell of this frame has been discarded. All cells are discarded up to but not including the EOM cell. The PPD function increases the 'goodput' of the link, since cells which are only going to be discarded at the AAL5 reassembly point are not transmitted. On CQC-based ATM cards, the packet-wise discard functions are PPD and EPD. PPD is available at VCC cell-transfer points. PPD is not applicable at frame-cell conversion points, and is not applicable for Vpcs. PPD is configured by this attribute. Packet-wise discard should only be enabled for connections carrying AAL5 segmentation traffic. Setting the value to enabled for any other traffic type may result in all traffic being discarded. On CQC-based ATM FPs, EPD is automatically enabled at frame-to-cell conversion points, independent of the setting of this attribute. On ATM IP cards, packet-wise discard functions include EPD and PPD. PPD and EPD apply to individual VCCs and VCCs within VPCs at all connection points, including tandem VPC connections. Both PPD and EPD are controlled by this attribute. This attribute may safely be set to enabled for any connection (Vcc or Vpc) on ATM IP FPs since they have the ability to automatically detect AAL5-segmented traffic on a connection, and only enable packet- wise discards if AAL5-segmented traffic is detected. When this attribute is set to enabled, packet-wise discard functions are applied to transmit traffic at this connection point. When this attribute is set to disabled, packet-wise discard functions are not applied to transmit traffic at this connection point. At a SPVC origin on a PNNI interface, a value of enabled specifies that frame discard is requested in the backward direction. When this attribute is set to disabled, backward frame discard is not requested in the SPVC call setup.

WRED is applied in the transmit direction for this connection. WRED function should be enabled only for connections which are transferring TCP/IP traffic. WRED acts to prevent synchronization of multiple TCP/IP sources by randomly discarding a small percentage of frames when transmit queue congestion reaches the designated level. W-RED may also be used to differentiate service on VCC's by preferentially discarding one VCC before another. Discards start at 0% of cells, when the queue is part-way to the Early Packet Discard (EPD) threshold, and rise to 100% of cells discarded at the EPD threshold. WRED discards all the cells in a frame. If this attribute is set to enabled, WRED is enabled for all applications linked to the given Vcc. If it is set to perFlow, each TCP application has individual control over whether to enable or disable WRED If txPacketWiseDiscard is set to disabled, or if this attribute is set to disabled, WRED functionality is disabled. If WRED is active, it is visible in the Vcc/Vpc Tm txPacketWiseDiscard operational attribute."

    "description": "This attribute specifies whether packet-wise discard functions are to be enabled or disabled in the receive data direction for this connection. Packet-wise discard functions should only be requested if this connection is transferring AAL5 frame traffic. This attribute is not applicable for Vpts. Packet-wise functions increase the 'goodput' of the link. The receive packet-wise function is Partial Packet Discard (PPD). PPD allows the connection to discard the remainder of a cell- forwarded AAL5 frame if one cell of this frame has been discarded, for example due to UPC. All cells are discarded up to but not including the EOM cell. The PPD function increases the 'goodput' of the link, since cells which are only going to be discarded at the AAL5 reassembly point are not transmitted. PPD is available at all VCC connection points where UPC may be activated. PPD is not applicable for Vpcs. On CQC-based ATM FPs, packet-wise discards should only be enabled for connections carrying AAL5 segmentation traffic. Setting the value to enabled for any other traffic type may result in traffic being discarded. On ATM IP cards, this attribute may safely be set to enabled for any connection (Vcc or Vpc) since they have the ability to automatically detect AAL5-segmented traffic on a connection, and only enables packet-wise discards if AAL5-segmented traffic is detected. When this attribute is set to enabled, packet-wise discard functions are applied to receive traffic at this connection point. When this attribute is set to disabled, packet-wise discard functions are not applied to receive traffic at this connection point. At a SPVC origin on a PNNI interface, a value of enabled specifies that frame discard is requested in the forward direction. When this attribute is set to disabled, forward frame discard is not requested in the SPVC call setup. The receive packet-wise discard functions that are active are visible in the Vcc/Vpc Tm rxPacketWiseDiscard operational attribute."

S/D mode is automatically invoked at this connection point either if this is a connection end point, or if the next hop connection point is configured as nonAbrInterworking. nonAbrInterworking is used to request that this connection point function as an interworking between ABR and non-ABR service categories. This means that there are no RM cells on the link side of this connection, and that the next hop connection point is performing as an ABR sourceDest. abrSwitch is used to request ABR switch behavior for this connection point. The ABR switch behavior is first, to confirm to virtualSourceDest or nonAbrInterworking setting on the next hop, and otherwise to implement ABR ER switch behavior.

The values of peak cell rate (PCR), sustained cell rate (SCR), Minimum Cell Rate (MCR) and requested shaping rate are expressed in cell/s. Maximum burst size (MBS) is expressed in cells. CDVT is expressed in microseconds. The values of PCR, SCR, MCR, MBS and CDVT are used for connection admission control (CAC). The value of CDVT is only used for connections where the atmServiceCategory is constantBitRate. For all other values of atmServiceCategory, CDVT is ignored. The values of PCR, SCR, MCR and requested shaping rate are used to determine the actual shaping rate where traffic shaping is enabled. When txTrafficDescType is 1 or 2, all of the parameters must be set to zero. When txTrafficDescType is 3, parameter 1 represents the PCR for CLP equal to 0 and 1 traffic; parameter 4 represents the CDVT; and parameter 5 represents the requested shaping rate. A non-zero value in parameter 5 overrides any value in parameter 1. This result is used as the PCR. Parameter 1 must be non-zero. Parameters 2 and 3 must be zero. When txTrafficDescType is 4, parameter 1 represents the PCR for CLP equal to 0 and 1 traffic with cell discard; parameter 2 represents the PCR for CLP equal to 0 traffic; parameter 4 represents the CDVT; and parameter 5 represents the requested shaping rate. A non-zero value in parameter 5 overrides any value in parameter 1. This result is used as the PCR. Parameter 1 must be greater than or equal to parameter 2. Parameters 1 and 2 must be non-zero. Parameter 3 must be zero.

When txTrafficDescType is 6, parameter 1 represents the PCR for CLP equal to 0 and 1 traffic; parameter 2 represents the SCR for CLP equal to 0 and 1 traffic; parameter 3 represents the MBS for CLP equal to 0 and 1 traffic; parameter 4 represents the CDVT; and parameter 5 represents the requested shaping rate. A non-zero value in parameter 5 overrides any value in parameter 1. This result is used as the PCR. Parameters 1, 2 and 3 must be non-zero. Parameter 1 must be greater than or equal to parameter 2. Parameter 5, must either be zero (unused) or greater than or equal to parameter 2. When txTrafficDescType is 7, parameter 1 represents the PCR for CLP equal to 0 and 1 traffic; parameter 2 represents the SCR for CLP equal to 0 with cell discard; parameter 3 represents the MBS for CLP equal to 0 traffic; parameter 4 represents the CDVT; and parameter 5 represents the requested shaping rate. A non-zero value in parameter 5 overrides any value in parameter 1. This result is used as the PCR. Parameters 1, 2 and 3 must be non-zero. Parameter 1 must be greater than or equal to parameter 2. Parameter 5, must either be zero (unused) or greater than or equal to parameter 2.

Parameter 5, must either be zero (unused) or greater than or equal to parameter 2. When txTrafficDescType is 9, parameter 1 represents the PCR; parameter 2 represents the CDVT; parameter 3 represents the MCR; parameter 4 and parameter 5 represent are not used and must be zero. Parameter 1 must be non-zero and must be greater than or equal to parameter 3. Parameter 3 may be optionally zero. Whenever it is valid for PCR to be specified, parameter 5 may also be used to specify a requested shaping rate. A non-zero value in parameter 5 overrides the value in parameter 1 and is used as the peak cell rate in calculations of CAC and shaping rate. When the atmServiceCategory is availableBitRate (ABR), the shaping rate is dynamically chosen, based on the ABR flow control mechanism, as a value between the MCR and the PCR or the requested shaping rate if applicable. For txTrafficDescType 3, 4 and 5, the transmit traffic is shaped at the next available shaping rate less than the PCR. For txTrafficDescType 6, 7 and 8 if linear traffic shaping is selected, the transmit traffic is shaped at the highest available rate which is between PCR and SCR. However, if there is no available shaping rate between PCR and SCR, traffic is shaped at the next rate above the PCR. For txTrafficDescType 6, 7 and 8 if inverse-UPC traffic shaping is selected, the transmit traffic is shaped at a variable rate which conforms to the PCR, SCR and MBS of the connection traffic descriptor. Inverse-UPC traffic shaping is available only on ATM IP cards."

When rxTrafficDescType is any value from 3 through 8, parameter 4 represents the CDVT. If the value of CDVT either in parameter 2 or in parameter 4 is zero, the CDVT is taken from the CA defaults for the particular atmServiceCategory of this connection. On a CQC-based ATM card, when rxTrafficDescriptorType is 3 through 8, there are certain extreme combinations of rxTrafficDescParm which are outside the capabilities of the UPC hardware. The check prov command detects such cases and generates an error message. If this happens, adjust the parameters until they fall within the supported limits. To calculate the limits, use the following formulae: I1 = 1 000 000 000 / PCR L1 = CDVT * 1000 I2 = 1,000,000,000 / SCR L2 = CDVT + (MBS - 1) * (I2 - I1) I1 and I2 must be less than or equal to 335,523,840. I1 + L1 must be less than or equal to 1,342,156,800. I2 + L2 must be less than or equal to 1,342,156,800. Note that I2 and L2 only apply when the rxTrafficDescriptorType is 6 through 8. If the values of I1, L1, I2 or L2 are closer to the limits described above, a further restriction applies. Specifically, if either: I1 > 41,940,480 or I2 > 41,940,480 or I1 + L1 > 167,769,600 or I2 + L2 > 167,769,600 then both I1 and I2 must be greater than 20,480. Parameter 5 of the rxTrafficDescParm is always unused. If the rxTrafficDescType is sameAsTx, the values provisioned in this attribute are ignored. The traffic parameters for the receive direction are taken from the txTrafficDescParm."

For example, if the target CLR = 1E-10 then Cbr cellLossRatio = 10. This number must be the same as the RtVbr cellLossRatio since CBR and rt-VBR traffic have the same discard priority. The Cbr cellLossRatio is used by the Connection Admission Control (CAC) algorithm to compute the required (equivalent) cell rate for CBR connections. There is a trade-off between the service category CLR and the achievable Vpt bandwidth utilization. To guarantee an excellent service category, the CLR should be as small as possible (e.g., 1E- 10). However, a smaller CLR results in a larger equivalent cell rate for a given connection and hence a lower Vpt bandwidth utilization. Setting this attribute to 0 means that a CLR of 1 can be tolerated. In this case, no bandwidth is reserved for CBR connections, and CAC is effectively turned off. All CBR connections are admitted."

For example, if the target CLR = 1E-10 then RtVbr cellLossRatio = 10. This number must be the same as the Cbr cellLossRatio since CBR and rt-VBR traffic have the same discard priority. The RtVbr cellLossRatio is used by the Connection Admission Control (CAC) algorithm to compute the required (equivalent) cell rate for rt-VBR connections. This number must be less than or equal to the NrtVbr cellLossRatio, since rt-VBR traffic has a higher discard priority. There is a trade-off between the service category CLR and the achievable Vpt bandwidth utilization. To guarantee an excellent service category, the CLR should be as small as possible (e.g., 1E- 10). However, a smaller CLR results in a larger equivalent cell rate for a given connection and hence a lower Vpt bandwidth utilization. Setting this attribute to 0 means that a CLR of 1 can be tolerated. In this case, no bandwidth is reserved for rt-VBR connections and CAC is effectively turned off. All rt-VBR connections are admitted."

This attribute does not apply to Virtual Link VPTs and will always be displayed as constantBitRate. The constantBitRate service category is intended for real time applications, that is, those requiring tightly constrained delay and delay variation, as would be appropriate for voice and video applications. The consistent availability of a fixed quantity of bandwidth is considered appropriate for CBR service. Cells which are delayed beyond the value specified by Cell Transfer Delay are assumed to have significantly reduced value for the application. The rtVariableBitRate service category is intended for real time applications; that is those requiring tightly constrained delay and delay variation, as would be appropriate for voice and video applications. Sources are expected to transmit at a rate which varies with time. Equivalently, the source can be described as 'bursty'. Cells which are delayed beyond the value specified by Cell Transfer Delay are assumed to be of significantly reduced value to the application. Real time VBR service may support statistical multiplexing of real time sources. The nrtVariableBitRate service category is intended for non-real time applications which have bursty traffic characteristics and which can be characterized in terms of a PCR, SCR, and MBS. For those cells which are transferred within the traffic contract, the application expects a low cell loss ratio. For all connections, it expects a bound on the mean cell transfer delay. Non-real time VBR service may support statistical multiplexing of connections. The availableBitRate service is an ATM layer service category for which the limiting ATM layer transfer characteristics provided by the network may change subsequent to connection establishment. ABR service has a flow control mechanism which supports several types of feedback to control the source rate in response to changing ATM layer transfer characteristics. ABR service is not intended to support real-time applications. The unspecifiedBitRate service is intended for non-real time applications, that is those not requiring tightly constrained delay and delay variation. UBR sources are expected to be bursty. UBR service supports a high degree of statistical multiplexing among sources. UBR service does not specify traffic related service guarantees. No numerical commitments are made with respect to the cell loss ratio experienced by a UBR connection, or as to the cell transfer delay experienced by cells on the connection."

For CQC-based ATM cards, the only possible values are notApplicable, efciSwitch or nonAbrInterworking.

The values of peak cell rate (PCR), sustained cell rate (SCR), Minimum Cell Rate (MCR), actual cell rate (ACR), explicit rate (ER), equivalent cell rate (ECR), and actual shaping rate are expressed in cell/s. Maximum burst size (MBS) is expressed in cells. CDVT is expressed in microseconds. When txTrafficDescType is 1 or 2, parameters 1 through 5 are unused. In this description, PCR is the greater of either the PCR or the requested shaping rate (parameter 1 or parameter 5) specified in the txTrafficDescParm attribute under the Vcd Tm or Vpd Tm component. When txTrafficDescType is 3, parameter 1 represents the PCR for CLP equal to 0 or 1 traffic; parameters 2 and 3 are unused. When txTrafficDescType is 4, parameter 1 represents the PCR for CLP equal to 0 and 1 traffic; parameter 2 represents the PCR for CLP equal to 0 traffic with cell discard. When txTrafficDescType is 5, parameter 1 represents the PCR for CLP equal to 0 and 1 traffic; parameter 2 represents the PCR for CLP equal to 0 traffic with cell tagging. When txTrafficDescType is 6, parameter 1 represents the PCR for CLP equal to 0 and 1 traffic; parameter 2 represents the SCR for CLP equal to 0 and 1 traffic; parameter 3 represents the MBS for CLP equal to 0 and 1 traffic. When txTrafficDescType is 7, parameter 1 represents the PCR for CLP equal to 0 and 1 traffic; parameter 2 represents the SCR for CLP equal to 0 traffic with cell discard; parameter 3 represents the MBS for CLP equal to 0 traffic. When txTrafficDescType is 8, parameter 1 represents the PCR for CLP equal to 0 and 1 traffic; parameter 2 represents the SCR for CLP equal to 0 traffic with cell tagging; parameter 3 represents the MBS for CLP equal to 0 traffic. When txTrafficDescType is 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8, parameter 4 reflects the actual shaping rate in cell/s for this connection. For CQC-based ATM cards, the set of available shaping rates is based on the number of interfaces doing shaping (attribute perVcQueueInterfaces), and the shapingScalingFactor attribute of the Arc Cqc Override component. A rate of zero (0) indicates that shaping is not performed, or that the interface is down. When txTrafficDescType is 9, parameter 1 represents the PCR; parameter 2 represents the Cell Delay Variation Toleration (CDVT); parameter 3 represents the Minimum Cell Rate (MCR); the meaning of parameter 4 depends upon the value of the abrConnectionType attribute. if abrConnectionType is sourceDest or virtualSourceDest, parameter 4 represents the Allowed Cell Rate (ACR); If abrConnectionType is erSwitch, parameter 4 represents the Explicit Rate (ER); and if abrConnectionType is efciSwitch, parameter 4 reflects the actual shaping rate in cell/s for this connection. When txTrafficDescType is 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9, parameter 5 reflects the equivalent cell rate in cell/s for this connection as determined by the Connection Admission Control (CAC) algorithm. The equivalent cell rate is useful in determining the admission characteristics of this connection."

    "description": "This attribute is a vector of four traffic parameters whose meanings are defined by the rxTrafficDescType attribute. The values of peak cell rate (PCR), sustained cell rate (SCR), minimum cell rate (MCR) are expressed in cell/s. Maximum burst size (MBS) is expressed in cells. Cell delay variation tolerance (CDVT) is expressed in microseconds. When rxTrafficDescType is 1 or 2, none of the parameters are used. When rxTrafficDescType is 3, parameter 1 represents the PCR for CLP equal to 0 and 1 traffic; parameter 4 represents the CDVT. When rxTrafficDescType is 4, parameter 1 represents the PCR for CLP equal to 0 and 1 traffic; parameter 2 represents the PCR for CLP equal to 0 traffic with cell discard; parameter 4 represents the CDVT. When rxTrafficDescType is 5, parameter 1 represents the PCR for CLP equal to 0 and 1 traffic; parameter 2 represents the PCR for CLP equal to 0 traffic with cell tagging; parameter 4 represents the CDVT. When rxTrafficDescType is 6, parameter 1 represents the PCR for CLP equal to 0 and 1 traffic; parameter 2 represents the SCR for CLP equal to 0 and 1 traffic; parameter 3 represents the MBS for CLP equal to 0 and 1 traffic; parameter 4 represents the CDVT. When rxTrafficDescType is 7, parameter 1 represents the PCR for CLP equal to 0 and 1 traffic; parameter 2 represents the SCR for CLP equal to 0 traffic with cell discard; parameter 3 represents the MBS for CLP equal to 0 traffic; parameter 4 represents the CDVT. When rxTrafficDescType is 8, parameter 1 represents the PCR for CLP equal to 0 and 1 traffic; parameter 2 represents the SCR for CLP equal to 0 traffic with cell tagging; parameter 3 represents the MBS for CLP equal to 0 traffic; parameter 4 represents the CDVT. When rxTrafficDescType is 9, parameter 1 represents the PCR; parameter 2 represents CDVT; parameter 3 represents the MCR; parameter 4 indicates the instantaneous rate at which dynamic generic cell rate algorithm (DGCRA) is in effect. If upc is disabled for this connection, the values of PCR, SCR, MBS and CDVT are the provisioned parameters. If upc is enabled, the values of PCR, SCR, MBS, and CDVT are exactly the values used by the usage parameter control hardware in policing the arriving traffic. These may vary slightly from the provisioned values due to granularity of the hardware. In the case where the PCR is equal to the SCR, the effective MBS is zero."

Its value reflects whether the rate of received OAM cells for this connection is below a specified threshold. The connection maintains a count of the number of OAM cells which are terminated per second. Once that count exceeds the specified threshold, extraction of all OAM cells for this connection is disabled for a period of one minute. This is a congestion management mechanism to prevent the processor from being overloaded with handling OAM cells for a particular connection. This mechanism ensures that tasks, such as trunks obtain enough processor cycles to remain in service, and are not adversely affected by excessive rate of OAM cells on a particular connection. The value is good when the rate of received OAM cells is less than the allowed threshold. The value is bad when the arrival rate has exceeded the allowed threshold. It remains bad for one minute, before returning to good again. During this timeout, extraction of all OAM cells is disabled for this connection. As a result, other loopback failure conditions may occur. The value is unknown when the application has not yet begun to use this connection. An example is the Test component before a test has been started. Each type of OAM cell is counted separately. The threshold for AIS cells is three cells per second. If more than three AIS cells are received within a one second interval, this attribute is set to bad. The threshold for RDI cells and each loopback type is also three, but the threshold for trace cells is 250 per second. The state of this attribute has no direct effect on the value of the operStatus attribute or on the number of troubled connections."

    "description": "This attribute is HISTORICAL. Please refer to the attribute of the same name in the group AtmTmOper. This attribute indicates the ATM service category used for traffic in both directions of the connection. The constantBitRate service category is intended for real time applications, that is, those requiring tightly constrained delay and delay variation, as would be appropriate for voice and video applications. The consistent availability of a fixed quantity of bandwidth is considered appropriate for CBR service. Cells which are delayed beyond the value specified by Cell Transfer Delay are assumed to have significantly reduced value of the application. The rtVariableBitRate service category is intended for real time applications; that is those requiring tightly constrained delay and delay variation, as would be appropriate for voice and video applications. Sources are expected to transmit at a rate which varies with time. Equivalently, the source can be described as 'bursty'. Cells which are delayed beyond the value specified by Cell Transfer Delay are assumed to be of significantly reduced value to the application. Real time VBR service may support statistical multiplexing of real time sources. The nrtVariableBitRate service category is intended for non-real time applications which have bursty traffic characteristics and which can be characterized in terms of a PCR, SCR, and MBS. For those cells which are transferred within the traffic contract, the application expects a low cell loss ratio. For all connections, it expects a bound on the mean cell transfer delay. Non-real time VBR service may support statistical multiplexing of connections. The unspecifiedBitRate service is intended for non-real time applications, that is those not requiring tightly constrained delay and delay variation. UBR sources are expected to be bursty. UBR service supports a high degree of statistical multiplexing among sources. UBR service does not specify traffic related service guarantees. No numerical commitments are made with respect to the cell loss ratio experienced by a UBR connection, or as to the cell transfer delay experienced by cells on the connection."

When txTrafficDescType is 8, parameter 1 represents the PCR for CLP equal to 0 and 1 traffic; parameter 2 represents the SCR for CLP equal to 0 traffic with cell tagging; parameter 3 represents the MBS for CLP equal to 0 traffic When txTrafficDescType is 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 or 8, parameter 4 reflects the actual shaping rate in cell/s for this connection. This rate is one of the set of available shaping rates for this type of ATM-FP, based on the number of interfaces doing shaping (attribute perVcQueueInterfaces), the provisioned cell rate, the shapingScalingFactor attribute of the AtmResourceControl component, and whether traffic shaping is enabled. A rate of zero (0) indicates that shaping is not performed. When txTrafficDescType is 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 or 8, parameter 5 reflects the equivalent cell rate in cell/s for this connection as determined by the Connection Admission Control (CAC) algorithm. The equivalent cell rate is useful in determining the admission characteristics of this connection."

This attribute is a vector of four traffic parameters whose meanings are defined by the rxTrafficDescType attribute. The values of peak cell rate (PCR), sustained cell rate (SCR) are expressed in cells/s. Maximum burst size (MBS) is expressed in cells. Cell Delay Variation Tolerance (CDVT) is expressed in microseconds. When rxTrafficDescType is 1 or 2, none of the parameters are used.

If Upc is disabled for this connection, the values of PCR, SCR, MBS and CDVT is a combination of provisioned parameters. If Upc is enabled, the values of PCR, SCR, MBS, and CDVT is exactly the values used by the usage parameter control hardware in policing the arriving traffic. These may vary slightly from the provisioned values due to granularity of the hardware. In the case where the PCR is equal to the SCR, the effective MBS is zero."

The value derivedFromBBC may only be used if the SrcPvc component is provisioned under this Vcc.Otherwise a specific ATM service category must be specified. If this attribute is set to derivedFromBBC, the Broadband Bearer Capability (BBC) and bestEffort attributes are used to determine the atmServiceCategory of this connection. If this attribute is set to other than derivedFromBBC, the value of this attribute is used to override the provisioned BBC Information Element parameters. In those cases, the BBC attributes are not used. The constantBitRate service category is intended for real time applications, that is those requiring tightly constrained delay and delay variation, as would be appropriate for voice and video applications. The consistent availability of a fixed quantity of bandwidth is considered appropriate for CBR service. Cells which are delayed beyond the value specified by Cell Transfer Delay are assumed to be of significantly reduce value to the application. The rtVariableBitRate service category is intended for real time applications, that is those requiring tightly constrained delay and delay variation, as would be appropriate for voice and video applications. Sources are expected to transmit at a rate which varies with time. Equivalently, the source can be described as 'bursty'. Cells which are delayed beyond the value specified by CTD are assumed to be of significantly reduced value to the application. Real time VBR service may support statistical multiplexing of real time sources. The nrtVariableBitRate service category is intended for non-real time applications which have bursty traffic characteristics and which can be characterized in terms of a PCR, SCR, and MBS. For those cells which are transferred within the traffic contract, the application expects a low cell loss ratio. For all connections, it expects a bound on the mean cell transfer delay. Non-real time VBR service may support statistical multiplexing of connections. The unspecifiedBitRate service is intended for non-real time applications; that is, those not requiring tightly constrained delay and delay variation. UBR sources are expected to be bursty. UBR service supports a high degree of statistical multiplexing among sources. UBR service does not specify traffic related service guarantees. No numerical commitments are made with respect to the cell loss ratio experienced by a UBR connection, or as to the cell transfer delay experienced by cells on the connection."

    "description": "This attribute is migrated to the AtmTmProv group. This attribute is a vector of five traffic parameters whose meanings are defined by the txTrafficDescType attribute. The values of peak cell rate (PCR), sustained cell rate (SCR) and requested shaping rate are expressed in cell/s. Maximum burst size (MBS) is expressed in cells. CDVT is expressed in microseconds. The values of PCR, SCR, MBS and CDVT are used for connection admission control (CAC). The value of CDVT is only used for connections where the atmServiceCategory is constantBitRate. For all other values of atmServiceCategory, CDVT is ignored. The values of PCR, SCR and requested shaping rate are used to determine the actual shaping rate where traffic shaping is enabled. When txTrafficDescType is 1 or 2, all of the parameters must be set to zero. When txTrafficDescType is 3, parameter 1 represents the PCR for CLP equal to 0 and 1 traffic; parameter 4 represents the CDVT; and parameter 5 represents the requested shaping rate. A non-zero value in parameter 5 overrides any value in parameter 1. This result is used as the PCR. Parameter 1 must be non-zero. Parameters 2 and 3 must be zero. When txTrafficDescType is 4, parameter 1 represents the PCR for CLP equal to 0 and 1 traffic with cell discard; parameter 2 represents the PCR for CLP equal to 0 traffic; parameter 4 represents the CDVT; and parameter 5 represents the requested shaping rate. A non-zero value in parameter 5 overrides any value in parameter 1. This result is used as the PCR. Parameter 1 must be greater than or equal to parameter 2. Parameters 1 and 2 must be non-zero. Parameter 3 must be zero. When txTrafficDescType is 5, parameter 1 represents the PCR for CLP equal to 0 and 1 traffic with cell tagging; parameter 2 represents the PCR for CLP equal to 0 traffic; parameter 4 represents the CDVT; and parameter 5 represents the requested shaping rate. A non-zero value in parameter 5 overrides any value in parameter 1. This result is used as the PCR. Parameter 1 must be greater than or equal to parameter 2. Parameters 1 and 2 must be non-zero. Parameter 3 must be zero. When txTrafficDescType is 6, parameter 1 represents the PCR for CLP equal to 0 and 1 traffic; parameter 2 represents the SCR for CLP equal to 0 and 1 traffic; parameter 3 represents the MBS for CLP equal to 0 and 1 traffic; parameter 4 represents the CDVT; and parameter 5 represents the requested shaping rate. A non-zero value in parameter 5 overrides any value in parameter 1. This result is used as the PCR. Parameters 1, 2 and 3 must be non-zero. Parameter 1 must be greater than or equal to parameter 2. Parameter 5, must either be zero (unused) or greater than or equal to parameter 2. When txTrafficDescType is 7, parameter 1 represents the PCR for CLP equal to 0 and 1 traffic; parameter 2 represents the SCR for CLP equal to 0 with cell discard; parameter 3 represents the MBS for CLP equal to 0 traffic; parameter 4 represents the CDVT; and parameter 5 represents the requested shaping rate. A non-zero value in parameter 5 overrides any value in parameter 1. This result is used as the PCR. Parameters 1, 2 and 3 must be non-zero. Parameter 1 must be greater than or equal to parameter 2. Parameter 5, must either be zero (unused) or greater than or equal to parameter 2. When txTrafficDescType is 8, parameter 1 represents the PCR for CLP equal to 0 and 1 traffic; parameter 2 represents the SCR for CLP equal to 0 traffic with cell tagging; parameter 3 represents the MBS for CLP equal to 0 traffic; parameter 4 represents the CDVT; and parameter 5 represents the requested shaping rate. A non-zero value in parameter 5 overrides any value in parameter 1. This result is used as the PCR. Parameters 1, 2 and 3 must be non-zero. Parameter 1 must be greater than or equal to parameter 2. Parameter 5, must either be zero (unused) or greater than or equal to parameter 2. Whenever it is valid for PCR to be specified, parameter 5 may also be used to specify a requested shaping rate. A non-zero value in parameter 5 overrides the value in parameter 1 and is used as the peak cell rate in calculations of CAC and shaping rate. For txTrafficDescType 3, 4 and 5, the transmit traffic is shaped at the next rate less than the PCR. For txTrafficDescType 6, 7 and 8, the transmit traffic is shaped at the highest available rate which is between PCR and SCR. However, if there is no available shaping rate between PCR and SCR, traffic is shaped at the next rate above the PCR."

    "description": "This attribute is migrated to the AtmTmProv group. This attribute is a vector of four traffic parameters whose meanings are defined by the rxTrafficDescType attribute. The values of peak cell rate (PCR) and sustained cell rate (SCR) are expressed in cell/s. Maximum burst size (MBS) is expressed in cells. The value of CDVT is expressed in microseconds. The values of PCR, SCR, MBS and CDVT are used for usage parameter control (UPC). When rxTrafficDescType is 1 or 2, all of the parameters must be set to zero (unused). When rxTrafficDescType is 3, parameter 1 represents the PCR for CLP equal to 0 and 1 traffic. Parameter 1 must be non-zero. Parameters 2 and 3 must be set to zero (unused). When rxTrafficDescType is 4, parameter 1 represents the PCR for CLP equal to 0 and 1 traffic; parameter 2 represents the PCR for CLP equal to 0 traffic with cell discard. Parameters 1 and 2 must be non-zero. Parameter 3 must be set to zero (unused). Parameter 1 must be greater than or equal to parameter 2. When rxTrafficDescType is 5, parameter 1 represents the PCR for CLP equal to 0 and 1 traffic; parameter 2 represents the PCR for CLP equal to 0 traffic with cell tagging. Parameters 1 and 2 must be non-zero. Parameter 3 must be set to zero (unused). Parameter 1 must be greater than or equal to parameter 2. When rxTrafficDescType is a 6, parameter 1 represents the PCR for CLP equal to 0 and 1 traffic; parameter 2 represents the SCR for CLP equal to 0 and 1 traffic; parameter 3 represents the MBS for CLP equal to 0 and 1 traffic. Parameters 1, 2 and 3 must be non- zero. Parameter 1 must be greater than or equal to Parameter 2. When rxTrafficDescType is 7, parameter 1 represents the PCR for CLP equal to 0 and 1 traffic; parameter 2 represents the SCR for CLP equal to 0 traffic with cell discard; parameter 3 represents the MBS for CLP equal to 0 traffic. Parameters 1, 2 and 3 must be non- zero. Parameter 1 must be greater than or equal to parameter 2. When rxTrafficDescType is 8, parameter 1 represents the PCR for CLP equal to 0 and 1 traffic; parameter 2 represents the SCR for CLP equal to 0 traffic with cell tagging; parameter 3 represents the MBS for CLP equal to 0 traffic. Parameter 1, 2 and 3 must be non- zero. Parameter 1 must be greater than or equal to parameter 2. When rxTrafficDescType is any value from 3 through 8, parameter 4 represents the CDVT. If this value is zero, the CDVT is taken from the ConnectionAdministrator defaults for the particular atmServiceCategory of this connection. When rxTrafficDescriptorType is 3 through 8, there are certain extreme combinations of rxTrafficDescParm which are outside the capabilities of the UPC hardware. The check prov command detects such cases and generates an error message. If this happens, adjust the parameters until they fall within the supported limits. To calculate the limits, use the following formulae: I1 = 1 000 000 000 / PCR L1 = CDVT * 1000 I2 = 1 000 000 000 / SCR L2 = CDVT + (MBS - 1) * (I2 - I1) I1 and I2 must be less than or equal to 335 523 840. I1 + L1 must be less than or equal to 1 342 156 800. I2 + L2 must be less than or equal to 1 342 156 800. Note that I2 and L2 only apply when the rxTrafficDescriptorType is 6 through 8. If the values of I1, L1, I2 or L2 are closer to the limits described above, a further restriction applies. Specifically, if either: I1 > 41 940 480 or I2 > 41 940 480 or I1 + L1 > 167 769 600 or I2 + L2 > 167 769 600 then both I1 and I2 must be greater than 20 480. Parameter 5 of the rxTrafficDescParm is always unused. If the rxTrafficDescType is sameAsTx, the values in this attribute are taken from the txTrafficDescParm."

The value derivedFromBBC may only be used if the SrcPvc component is provisioned under this Vcc. Otherwise a specific ATM service category must be specified. If this attribute is set to derivedFromBBC, the Broadband Bearer Capability (BBC) and bestEffort attributes are used to determine the atmServiceCategory of this connection. If this attribute is set to other than derivedFromBBC, the value of this attribute is used to override the provisioned BBC Information Element parameters. In those cases, the BBC attributes are not used. The constantBitRate service category is intended for real time applications, that is those requiring tightly constrained delay and delay variation, as would be appropriate for voice and video applications. The consistent availability of a fixed quantity of bandwidth is considered appropriate for CBR service. Cells which are delayed beyond the value specified by Cell Transfer Delay are assumed to be of significantly reduced value to the application. The rtVariableBitRate service category is intended for real time applications, that is those requiring tightly constrained delay and delay variation, as would be appropriate for voice and video applications. Sources are expected to transmit at a rate which varies with time. Equivalently, the source can be described as 'bursty'. Cells which are delayed beyond the value specified by CTD are assumed to be of significantly reduced value to the application. Real time VBR service may support statistical multiplexing of real time sources. The nrtVariableBitRate service category is intended for non-real time applications which have bursty traffic characteristics and which can be characterized in terms of a PCR, SCR, and MBS. For those cells which are transferred within the traffic contract, the application expects a low cell loss ratio. For all connections, it expects a bound on the mean cell transfer delay. Non-real time VBR service may support statistical multiplexing of connections. The availableBitRate service is an ATM layer service category for which the limiting ATM layer transfer characteristics provided by the network may change subsequent to connection establishment. ABR service has a flow control mechanism which supports several types of feedback to control the source rate in response to changing ATM layer transfer characteristics. ABR service is not intended to support real-time applications. The unspecifiedBitRate service is intended for non-real time applications; that is, those not requiring tightly constrained delay and delay variation. UBR sources are expected to be bursty. UBR service supports a high degree of statistical multiplexing among sources. UBR service does not specify traffic related service guarantees. No numerical commitments are made with respect to the cell loss ratio experienced by a UBR connection, or as to the cell transfer delay experienced by cells on the connection."

Packet-wise discard functions should only be requested if this connection is transferring AAL5 frame traffic. This attribute is not applicable for Vpts. Packet-wise functions increase the 'goodput' of the link. The transmit packet-wise functions are Early Packet Discard (EPD) and Partial Packet Discard (PPD). EPD allows the connection to discard an entire frame once the transmit queue has reached the EPD threshold. EPD increases the 'goodput' of a link, since discarding an entire frame means that some queue capacity is guarded for some other frame which is already partially transmitted. All cells of the frame are discarded from the Beginning of Message (BOM) cell up to and including the End of Message (EOM) cell. PPD allows the connection to discard the remainder of a cell- forwarded AAL5 frame if one cell of this frame has been discarded. All cells are discarded up to but not including the EOM cell. The PPD function increases the 'goodput' of the link, since cells which are only going to be discarded at the AAL5 reassembly point are not transmitted. On CQC-based ATM cards, the packet-wise discard functions are PPD and EPD. PPD is available at VCC cell-transfer points. PPD is not applicable at frame-cell conversion points, and is not applicable for Vpcs. PPD is configured by this attribute. Packet-wise discard should only be enabled for connections carrying AAL5 segmentation traffic. Setting the value to enabled for any other traffic type may result in all traffic being discarded. On CQC-based ATM FPs, EPD is automatically enabled at frame-to-cell conversion points, independent of the setting of this attribute.

This attribute may safely be set to enabled for any connection (Vcc or Vpc) on ATM IP FPs since they have the ability to automatically detect AAL5-segmented traffic on a connection, and only enable packet- wise discards if AAL5-segmented traffic is detected.

The values of peak cell rate (PCR), sustained cell rate (SCR), Minimum Cell Rate (MCR) and requested shaping rate are expressed in cell/s. Maximum burst size (MBS) is expressed in cells. CDVT is expressed in microseconds. The values of PCR, SCR, MCR, MBS and CDVT are used for connection admission control (CAC). The value of CDVT is only used for connections where the atmServiceCategory is constantBitRate. For all other values of atmServiceCategory, CDVT is ignored. The values of PCR, SCR, MCR and requested shaping rate are used to determine the actual shaping rate where traffic shaping is enabled. When txTrafficDescType is 1 or 2, all of the parameters must be set to zero. When txTrafficDescType is 3, parameter 1 represents the PCR for CLP equal to 0 and 1 traffic; parameter 4 represents the CDVT; and parameter 5 represents the requested shaping rate. A non-zero value in parameter 5 overrides any value in parameter 1. This result is used as the PCR. Parameter 1 must be non-zero. Parameters 2 and 3 must be zero. When txTrafficDescType is 4, parameter 1 represents the PCR for CLP equal to 0 and 1 traffic with cell discard; parameter 2 represents the PCR for CLP equal to 0 traffic; parameter 4 represents the CDVT; and parameter 5 represents the requested shaping rate. A non-zero value in parameter 5 overrides any value in parameter 1. This result is used as the PCR. Parameter 1 must be greater than or equal to parameter 2. Parameters 1 and 2 must be non-zero. Parameter 3 must be zero. When txTrafficDescType is 5, parameter 1 represents the PCR for CLP equal to 0 and 1 traffic with cell tagging; parameter 2 represents the PCR for CLP equal to 0 traffic; parameter 4 represents the CDVT; and parameter 5 represents the requested shaping rate. A non-zero value in parameter 5 overrides any value in parameter 1. This result is used as the PCR. Parameter 1 must be greater than or equal to parameter 2. Parameters 1 and 2 must be non-zero. Parameter 3 must be zero. When txTrafficDescType is 6, parameter 1 represents the PCR for CLP equal to 0 and 1 traffic; parameter 2 represents the SCR for CLP equal to 0 and 1 traffic; parameter 3 represents the MBS for CLP equal to 0 and 1 traffic; parameter 4 represents the CDVT; and parameter 5 represents the requested shaping rate. A non-zero value in parameter 5 overrides any value in parameter 1. This result is used as the PCR. Parameters 1, 2 and 3 must be non-zero. Parameter 1 must be greater than or equal to parameter 2. Parameter 5, must either be zero (unused) or greater than or equal to parameter 2. When txTrafficDescType is 7, parameter 1 represents the PCR for CLP equal to 0 and 1 traffic; parameter 2 represents the SCR for CLP equal to 0 with cell discard; parameter 3 represents the MBS for CLP equal to 0 traffic; parameter 4 represents the CDVT; and parameter 5 represents the requested shaping rate. A non-zero value in parameter 5 overrides any value in parameter 1. This result is used as the PCR. Parameters 1, 2 and 3 must be non-zero. Parameter 1 must be greater than or equal to parameter 2. Parameter 5, must either be zero (unused) or greater than or equal to parameter 2. When txTrafficDescType is 8, parameter 1 represents the PCR for CLP equal to 0 and 1 traffic; parameter 2 represents the SCR for CLP equal to 0 traffic with cell tagging; parameter 3 represents the MBS for CLP equal to 0 traffic; parameter 4 represents the CDVT; and parameter 5 represents the requested shaping rate. A non-zero value in parameter 5 overrides any value in parameter 1. This result is used as the PCR. Parameters 1, 2 and 3 must be non-zero. Parameter 1 must be greater than or equal to parameter 2. Parameter 5, must either be zero (unused) or greater than or equal to parameter 2. When txTrafficDescType is 9, parameter 1 represents the PCR; parameter 2 represents the CDVT; parameter 3 represents the MCR; parameter 4 and parameter 5 represent are not used and must be zero. Parameter 1 must be non-zero and must be greater than or equal to parameter 3. Parameter 3 may be optionally zero. Whenever it is valid for PCR to be specified, parameter 5 may also be used to specify a requested shaping rate. A non-zero value in parameter 5 overrides the value in parameter 1 and is used as the peak cell rate in calculations of CAC and shaping rate. When the atmServiceCategory is availableBitRate (ABR), the shaping rate is dynamically chosen, based on the ABR flow control mechanism, as a value between the MCR and the PCR or the requested shaping rate if applicable. For txTrafficDescType 3, 4 and 5, the transmit traffic is shaped at the next available shaping rate less than the PCR. For txTrafficDescType 6, 7 and 8 if linear traffic shaping is selected, the transmit traffic is shaped at the highest available rate which is between PCR and SCR. However, if there is no available shaping rate between PCR and SCR, traffic is shaped at the next rate above the PCR. For txTrafficDescType 6, 7 and 8 if inverse-UPC traffic shaping is selected, the transmit traffic is shaped at a variable rate which conforms to the PCR, SCR and MBS of the connection traffic descriptor. Inverse-UPC traffic shaping is available only on ATM IP cards."

    "description": "This attribute is a vector of four traffic parameters whose meanings are defined by the rxTrafficDescType attribute. The values of peak cell rate (PCR), sustained cell rate (SCR) and Minimum Cell Rate (MCR) are expressed in cell/s. Maximum burst size (MBS) is expressed in cells. The value of CDVT is expressed in microseconds. The values of PCR, SCR, MCR, MBS and CDVT are used for usage parameter control (UPC). When rxTrafficDescType is 1 or 2, all of the parameters must be set to zero (unused). When rxTrafficDescType is 3, parameter 1 represents the PCR for CLP equal to 0 and 1 traffic. Parameter 1 must be non-zero. Parameters 2 and 3 must be set to zero (unused).

Parameters 1, 2 and 3 must be non- zero. Parameter 1 must be greater than or equal to parameter 2. When rxTrafficDescType is 8, parameter 1 represents the PCR for CLP equal to 0 and 1 traffic; parameter 2 represents the SCR for CLP equal to 0 traffic with cell tagging; parameter 3 represents the MBS for CLP equal to 0 traffic. Parameter 1, 2 and 3 must be non- zero. Parameter 1 must be greater than or equal to parameter 2. When rxTrafficDescType is 9, parameter 1 represents the PCR; parameter 2 represents the CDVT; parameter 3 represents the MCR. Parameter 4 is not used and must be zero. Parameter 1,must be non- zero and must be greater than or equal to parameter 3. Parameter 3 may optionally be zero. When rxTrafficDescType is any value from 3 through 8, parameter 4 represents the CDVT. If the value of CDVT either in parameter 2 or in parameter 4 is zero, the CDVT is taken from the CA defaults for the particular atmServiceCategory of this connection. On a CQC-based ATM card, when rxTrafficDescriptorType is 3 through 8, there are certain extreme combinations of rxTrafficDescParm which are outside the capabilities of the UPC hardware. The check prov command detects such cases and generates an error message. If this happens, adjust the parameters until they fall within the supported limits. To calculate the limits, use the following formulae: I1 = 1 000 000 000 / PCR L1 = CDVT * 1000 I2 = 1,000,000,000 / SCR L2 = CDVT + (MBS - 1) * (I2 - I1) I1 and I2 must be less than or equal to 335,523,840. I1 + L1 must be less than or equal to 1,342,156,800. I2 + L2 must be less than or equal to 1,342,156,800. Note that I2 and L2 only apply when the rxTrafficDescriptorType is 6 through 8. If the values of I1, L1, I2 or L2 are closer to the limits described above, a further restriction applies. Specifically, if either: I1 > 41,940,480 or I2 > 41,940,480 or I1 + L1 > 167,769,600 or I2 + L2 > 167,769,600 then both I1 and I2 must be greater than 20,480. Parameter 5 of the rxTrafficDescParm is always unused. If the rxTrafficDescType is sameAsTx, the values provisioned in this attribute are ignored. The traffic parameters for the receive direction are taken from the txTrafficDescParm."

This attribute does not apply to Virtual Link VPTs and will always be displayed as constantBitRate. The constantBitRate service category is intended for real time applications, that is, those requiring tightly constrained delay and delay variation, as would be appropriate for voice and video applications. The consistent availability of a fixed quantity of bandwidth is considered appropriate for CBR service. Cells which are delayed beyond the value specified by Cell Transfer Delay are assumed to have significantly reduced value for the application. The rtVariableBitRate service category is intended for real time applications; that is those requiring tightly constrained delay and delay variation, as would be appropriate for voice and video applications. Sources are expected to transmit at a rate which varies with time. Equivalently, the source can be described as 'bursty'. Cells which are delayed beyond the value specified by Cell Transfer Delay are assumed to be of significantly reduced value to the application. Real time VBR service may support statistical multiplexing of real time sources. The nrtVariableBitRate service category is intended for non-real time applications which have bursty traffic characteristics and which can be characterized in terms of a PCR, SCR, and MBS. For those cells which are transferred within the traffic contract, the application expects a low cell loss ratio. For all connections, it expects a bound on the mean cell transfer delay. Non-real time VBR service may support statistical multiplexing of connections. The availableBitRate service is an ATM layer service category for which the limiting ATM layer transfer characteristics provided by the network may change subsequent to connection establishment. ABR service has a flow control mechanism which supports several types of feedback to control the source rate in response to changing ATM layer transfer characteristics. ABR service is not intended to support real-time applications. The unspecifiedBitRate service is intended for non-real time applications, that is those not requiring tightly constrained delay and delay variation. UBR sources are expected to be bursty. UBR service supports a high degree of statistical multiplexing among sources. UBR service does not specify traffic related service guarantees. No numerical commitments are made with respect to the cell loss ratio experienced by a UBR connection, or as to the cell transfer delay experienced by cells on the connection."

    "description": "This attribute is only of importance for connections which are carried on a link with a variable bandwidth. For example, the bandwidth may be reduced in the event that one or more physical links in the IMA group fail, such that the originally requested bandwidth cannot be maintained. This attribute shows whether the application (for example, Trunk) running on this connection can continue to operate if the bandwidth is reduced. If the bandwidth is reduced, the amount by which it is reduced is displayed in the bandwidthReduction attribute. A value of yes, indicates that this connection is elastic, and the bandwidth may be reduced but the connection is not released. A value of no indicates that the bandwidth for this connection is not reduced in the event of link bandwidth reduction. However, this connection may be released based on its holdingPriority. Bandwidth elasticity has no effect for connections which have an equivalent cell rate (ECR) of zero. This attribute is not applicable for Vpts and Vpt Vccs."

If the atmServiceCategory attribute is not availableBitRate, or if the connection is not active, this attribute value is displayed as notApplicable. For CQC-based ATM cards, the only possible values are notApplicable, efciSwitch or nonAbrInterworking. In EFCI marking mode, the Explicit Forward Congestion Indication (EFCI) field in the data cell headers is used to indicate transmit queue congestion. For ATM IP cards, if the connectionPointType is displayed as connectionEndPoint, this attribute has the value sourceDest. In this mode, the ABR Source and Destination behavior is in effect at this connection. This attribute is also sourceDest in the case where the next hop connection is specified as nonAbrInterworking. The next hop connection is the Vcc or Vpc identified by the nextHop attribute of the Nrp or Rp component. If the connectionPointType is not connectionEndPoint, the value of this attribute depends upon the abrConnectionType provisioning and the card type to which the traffic is forwarded on the backplane. The default abrConnectionType is provisioned at the CA Abr abrConnectionType attribute, and may be overridden for a provisioned connection in the Vcd Tm abrConnectionType or Vpd Tm abrConnectionType attribute. If the CA Abr abrConnectionType attribute is virtualSourceDest at either one of the two connection points, and if both the connection points are defined on ATM IP cards, virtual source and destination behavior is applied to the connection. In this instance, the attribute displays the value virtualSourceDest. This attribute has the value erSwitch if ABR explicit rate functionality is in effect at this connection. In this mode, the switch may modify the Explicit Rate (ER) field of backward Resource Management (RM) cells to indicate the status of congestion at this connection point. This attribute has the value nonAbrInterworking in the case where this connection point is functioning as an SPVC origin for an ABR connection where the link side of this connection is configured as a non-ABR ATM service category. This means that there are no RM cells on the link side of this connection, and that the next hop connection point is performing as an ABR sourceDest."

    "description": "This attribute is a vector of five transmit traffic parameters whose mapping is defined by the txTrafficDescType attribute. The values of peak cell rate (PCR), sustained cell rate (SCR), Minimum Cell Rate (MCR), actual cell rate (ACR), explicit rate (ER), equivalent cell rate (ECR), and actual shaping rate are expressed in cell/s. Maximum burst size (MBS) is expressed in cells. CDVT is expressed in microseconds. When txTrafficDescType is 1 or 2, parameters 1 through 5 are unused. In this description, PCR is the greater of either the PCR or the requested shaping rate (parameter 1 or parameter 5) specified in the txTrafficDescParm attribute under the Vcd Tm or Vpd Tm component. When txTrafficDescType is 3, parameter 1 represents the PCR for CLP equal to 0 or 1 traffic; parameters 2 and 3 are unused. When txTrafficDescType is 4, parameter 1 represents the PCR for CLP equal to 0 and 1 traffic; parameter 2 represents the PCR for CLP equal to 0 traffic with cell discard. When txTrafficDescType is 5, parameter 1 represents the PCR for CLP equal to 0 and 1 traffic; parameter 2 represents the PCR for CLP equal to 0 traffic with cell tagging. When txTrafficDescType is 6, parameter 1 represents the PCR for CLP equal to 0 and 1 traffic; parameter 2 represents the SCR for CLP equal to 0 and 1 traffic; parameter 3 represents the MBS for CLP equal to 0 and 1 traffic. When txTrafficDescType is 7, parameter 1 represents the PCR for CLP equal to 0 and 1 traffic; parameter 2 represents the SCR for CLP equal to 0 traffic with cell discard; parameter 3 represents the MBS for CLP equal to 0 traffic. When txTrafficDescType is 8, parameter 1 represents the PCR for CLP equal to 0 and 1 traffic; parameter 2 represents the SCR for CLP equal to 0 traffic with cell tagging; parameter 3 represents the MBS for CLP equal to 0 traffic. When txTrafficDescType is 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8, parameter 4 reflects the actual shaping rate in cell/s for this connection. For CQC-based ATM cards, the set of available shaping rates is based on the number of interfaces doing shaping (attribute perVcQueueInterfaces), and the shapingScalingFactor attribute of the Arc Cqc Override component. A rate of zero (0) indicates that shaping is not performed, or that the interface is down. When txTrafficDescType is 9, parameter 1 represents the PCR; parameter 2 represents the Cell Delay Variation Toleration (CDVT); parameter 3 represents the Minimum Cell Rate (MCR); the meaning of parameter 4 depends upon the value of the abrConnectionType attribute. if abrConnectionType is sourceDest or virtualSourceDest, parameter 4 represents the Allowed Cell Rate (ACR); If abrConnectionType is erSwitch, parameter 4 represents the Explicit Rate (ER); and if abrConnectionType is efciSwitch, parameter 4 reflects the actual shaping rate in cell/s for this connection. When txTrafficDescType is 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9, parameter 5 reflects the equivalent cell rate in cell/s for this connection as determined by the Connection Admission Control (CAC) algorithm. The equivalent cell rate is useful in determining the admission characteristics of this connection."

    "description": "This attribute specifies the minimum bandwidth guarantee associated with this EmissionPriority. A minimum bandwidth guarantee is designed to prevent starvation of traffic at this EP by traffic at higher EPs. Minimum bandwidth guarantees only operate for EPs within the guaranteed bandwidth range 2 through 7. The minimum bandwidth guarantee specified is a percentage of the bandwidth which remains after all traffic at EP 0 and EP 1 is served. For example, if EP 0 and EP 1 traffic consumes 20% of link bandwidth, the minimum bandwidth guarantee applies to the remaining 80% of the link bandwidth. A minimum bandwidth guarantee of 2% would actually result in this EP getting 2% of 80% (total 1.6%) of the link bandwidth. The sum of minimumBandwidthGuarantee values for all Eps under an AtmIf must not exceed 100%. The value priority specifies that this Ep gets the bandwidth guarantee which is applicable based on the hierarchy of emission priorities. In this case, there is no minimum bandwidth guarantee. A value between 1 and 49 specifies that from 1% to 49% of the remaining link bandwidth is reserved for traffic at this EP. Given a value n of minimumBandwidthGuarantee, then for n% of transmit cell opportunities in the guaranteed bandwidth range, this EP get first opportunity to send a cell. If this EP uses less than n% of the link bandwidth, the extra opportunities are allocated in priority. Due to scheduling and cell arrival times, traffic at this EP may not necessarily achieve full utilization of its minimum bandwidth guarantee. When specifying a value for minimumBandwidthGuarantee, consider the effect on cell delay variation (CDV) of traffic which would normally be of higher priority. For example, if RtVbr service category traffic is assigned to Ep/2 and Ubr traffic is assigned on Ep/7 where Ep/7 has a minimumBandwidthGuarantee of 25%, there can be a large impact on CDV of the RtVbr traffic. Traffic of the Cbr or RtVbr service category which is sensitive to CDV and is of known volume, can be assigned on EP 0 or EP 1 which are independent of the effects of minimum bandwidth guarantee.
