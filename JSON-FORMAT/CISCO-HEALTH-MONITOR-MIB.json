    "description": "Health Monitor MIB module. The Health Monitor uses a model based on events of varying severity and frequency, and predefined rules, to generate a metric that represents a system's (and its subsystems') level of health. The events are typically internally generated notifications in response to detrimental or correctional changes in the state of the hardware or software of the system. Detrimental events are classified under one of the following severity levels: Catastrophic - Causes or leads to system failure Critical - Major subsystem or functionality failure High - Potential for major impact to important functions Medium - Potential for minor impact to functionality Low - Negligible impact to functionality Whilst correctional events fall under the following classification: Positive - Not a fault event. May cause or lead to the return of functionality This MIB module provides information for tracking occurrences of the above events, and presents the associated health metric for the system and its component subsystems."
