Changes include the following: o This MIB module includes support for IPv6 addressing and the IPv6 scoped address architecture. [RFC2932] supported only IPv4. o This MIB module allows several multicast protocols to perform routing on a single interface, where [RFC2932] assumed each interface supported at most one multicast routing protocol. Multicast routing protocols are now per-route, see ipMcastRouteProtocol. o This MIB module includes objects that are not specific to multicast routing. It allows management of multicast function on systems that do not perform routing, whereas [RFC2932] was restricted to multicast routing. o This MIB module includes a table of Source-Specific Multicast (SSM) address ranges to which SSM semantics [RFC3569] should be applied. o This MIB module includes a table of local applications that are receiving multicast data. o This MIB module includes a table of multicast scope zones."
