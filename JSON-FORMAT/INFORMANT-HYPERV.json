    "description": "Indicates the current statuses of the element. Various operational statuses are defined. Many of the enumeration's values are self-explanatory. However, a few are not and are described here in more detail. 'Stressed' indicates that the element is functioning, but needs attention. Examples of 'Stressed' states are overload, overheated, and so on. 'Predictive Failure' indicates that an element is functioning nominally but predicting a failure in the near future. 'In Service' describes an element being configured, maintained, cleaned, or otherwise administered. 'No Contact' indicates that the monitoring system has knowledge of this element, but has never been able to establish communications with it. 'Lost Communication' indicates that the ManagedSystem Element is known to exist and has been contacted successfully in the past, but is currently unreachable. 'Stopped' and 'Aborted' are similar, although the former implies a clean and orderly stop, while the latter implies an abrupt stop where the state and configuration of the element might need to be updated. 'Dormant' indicates that the element is inactive or quiesced. 'Supporting Entity in Error' indicates that this element might be 'OK' but that another element, on which it is dependent, is in error. An example is a network service or endpoint that cannot function due to lower-layer networking problems. 'Completed' indicates that the element has completed its operation. This value should be combined with either OK, Error, or Degraded so that a client can tell if the complete operation Completed with OK (passed), Completed with Error (failed), or Completed with Degraded (the operation finished, but it did not complete OK or did not report an error). 'Power Mode' indicates that the element has additional power model information contained in the Associated PowerManagementService association. OperationalStatus replaces the Status property on ManagedSystemElement to provide a consistent approach to enumerations, to address implementation needs for an array property, and to provide a migration path from today's environment to the future. This change was not made earlier because it required the deprecated qualifier. Due to the widespread use of the existing Status property in management applications, it is strongly recommended that providers or instrumentation provide both the Status and OperationalStatus properties. Further, the first value of OperationalStatus should contain the primary status for the element. When instrumented, Status (because it is single-valued) should also provide the primary status of the element."

This property is deprecated in lieu of OperationalStatus, which includes the same semantics in its enumeration. This change is made for 3 reasons: 1) Status is more correctly defined as an array. This definition overcomes the limitation of describing status using a single value, when it is really a multi-valued property (for example, an element might be OK AND Stopped. 2) A MaxLen of 10 is too restrictive and leads to unclear enumerated values. 3) The change to a uint16 data type was discussed when CIM V2.0 was defined. However, existing V1.0 implementations used the string property and did not want to modify their code. Therefore, Status was grandfathered into the Schema. Use of the deprecated qualifier allows the maintenance of the existing property, but also permits an improved definition using OperationalStatus."

However, a few are not and are described here in more detail. 'Stressed' indicates that the element is functioning, but needs attention. Examples of 'Stressed' states are overload, overheated, and so on. 'Predictive Failure' indicates that an element is functioning nominally but predicting a failure in the near future. 'In Service' describes an element being configured, maintained, cleaned, or otherwise administered. 'No Contact' indicates that the monitoring system has knowledge of this element, but has never been able to establish communications with it. 'Lost Communication' indicates that the ManagedSystem Element is known to exist and has been contacted successfully in the past, but is currently unreachable. 'Stopped' and 'Aborted' are similar, although the former implies a clean and orderly stop, while the latter implies an abrupt stop where the state and configuration of the element might need to be updated. 'Dormant' indicates that the element is inactive or quiesced. 'Supporting Entity in Error' indicates that this element might be 'OK' but that another element, on which it is dependent, is in error. An example is a network service or endpoint that cannot function due to lower-layer networking problems. 'Completed' indicates that the element has completed its operation. This value should be combined with either OK, Error, or Degraded so that a client can tell if the complete operation Completed with OK (passed), Completed with Error (failed), or Completed with Degraded (the operation finished, but it did not complete OK or did not report an error). 'Power Mode' indicates that the element has additional power model information contained in the Associated PowerManagementService association. OperationalStatus replaces the Status property on ManagedSystemElement to provide a consistent approach to enumerations, to address implementation needs for an array property, and to provide a migration path from today's environment to the future. This change was not made earlier because it required the deprecated qualifier. Due to the widespread use of the existing Status property in management applications, it is strongly recommended that providers or instrumentation provide both the Status and OperationalStatus properties. Further, the first value of OperationalStatus should contain the primary status for the element. When instrumented, Status (because it is single-valued) should also provide the primary status of the element."

This property is provided to compare the last requested and current enabled or disabled states. Note that when EnabledState is set to 5 ('Not Applicable'), then this property has no meaning. By default, the RequestedState of the element is 5 ('No Change'). Refer to the EnabledState property description for explanations of the values in the RequestedState enumeration. It should be noted that there are two new values in RequestedState that build on the statuses of EnabledState. These are 'Reboot' (10) and 'Reset' (11). Reboot refers to doing a 'Shut Down' and then moving to an 'Enabled' state. Reset indicates that the element is first 'Disabled' and then 'Enabled'. The distinction between requesting 'Shut Down' and 'Disabled' should also be noted. Shut Down requests an orderly transition to the Disabled state, and might involve removing power, to completely erase any existing state. The Disabled state requests an immediate disabling of the element, such that it will not execute or accept any commands or processing requests. This property is set as the result of a method invocation (such as Start or StopService on CIM_Service), or can be overridden and defined as WRITEable in a subclass. The method approach is considered superior to a WRITEable property, because it allows an explicit invocation of the operation and the return of a result code. A particular instance of EnabledLogicalElement might not support RequestedStateChange. If this occurs, the value 12 ('Not Applicable') is used."

This definition overcomes the limitation of describing status using a single value, when it is really a multi-valued property (for example, an element might be OK AND Stopped. 2) A MaxLen of 10 is too restrictive and leads to unclear enumerated values. 3) The change to a uint16 data type was discussed when CIM V2.0 was defined. However, existing V1.0 implementations used the string property and did not want to modify their code. Therefore, Status was grandfathered into the Schema. Use of the deprecated qualifier allows the maintenance of the existing property, but also permits an improved definition using OperationalStatus."

However, a few are not and are described here in more detail. 'Stressed' indicates that the element is functioning, but needs attention. Examples of 'Stressed' states are overload, overheated, and so on. 'Predictive Failure' indicates that an element is functioning nominally but predicting a failure in the near future. 'In Service' describes an element being configured, maintained, cleaned, or otherwise administered. 'No Contact' indicates that the monitoring system has knowledge of this element, but has never been able to establish communications with it. 'Lost Communication' indicates that the ManagedSystem Element is known to exist and has been contacted successfully in the past, but is currently unreachable. 'Stopped' and 'Aborted' are similar, although the former implies a clean and orderly stop, while the latter implies an abrupt stop where the state and configuration of the element might need to be updated. 'Dormant' indicates that the element is inactive or quiesced. 'Supporting Entity in Error' indicates that this element might be 'OK' but that another element, on which it is dependent, is in error. An example is a network service or endpoint that cannot function due to lower-layer networking problems. 'Completed' indicates that the element has completed its operation. This value should be combined with either OK, Error, or Degraded so that a client can tell if the complete operation Completed with OK (passed), Completed with Error (failed), or Completed with Degraded (the operation finished, but it did not complete OK or did not report an error). 'Power Mode' indicates that the element has additional power model information contained in the Associated PowerManagementService association. OperationalStatus replaces the Status property on ManagedSystemElement to provide a consistent approach to enumerations, to address implementation needs for an array property, and to provide a migration path from today's environment to the future. This change was not made earlier because it required the deprecated qualifier. Due to the widespread use of the existing Status property in management applications, it is strongly recommended that providers or instrumentation provide both the Status and OperationalStatus properties. Further, the first value of OperationalStatus should contain the primary status for the element. When instrumented, Status (because it is single-valued) should also provide the primary status of the element."

This property is provided to compare the last requested and current enabled or disabled states. Note that when EnabledState is set to 5 ('Not Applicable'), then this property has no meaning. By default, the RequestedState of the element is 5 ('No Change'). Refer to the EnabledState property description for explanations of the values in the RequestedState enumeration. It should be noted that there are two new values in RequestedState that build on the statuses of EnabledState. These are 'Reboot' (10) and 'Reset' (11). Reboot refers to doing a 'Shut Down' and then moving to an 'Enabled' state. Reset indicates that the element is first 'Disabled' and then 'Enabled'. The distinction between requesting 'Shut Down' and 'Disabled' should also be noted. Shut Down requests an orderly transition to the Disabled state, and might involve removing power, to completely erase any existing state. The Disabled state requests an immediate disabling of the element, such that it will not execute or accept any commands or processing requests. This property is set as the result of a method invocation (such as Start or StopService on CIM_Service), or can be overridden and defined as WRITEable in a subclass. The method approach is considered superior to a WRITEable property, because it allows an explicit invocation of the operation and the return of a result code. A particular instance of EnabledLogicalElement might not support RequestedStateChange. If this occurs, the value 12 ('Not Applicable') is used."

This property is deprecated in lieu of OperationalStatus, which includes the same semantics in its enumeration. This change is made for 3 reasons: 1) Status is more correctly defined as an array. This definition overcomes the limitation of describing status using a single value, when it is really a multi-valued property (for example, an element might be OK AND Stopped. 2) A MaxLen of 10 is too restrictive and leads to unclear enumerated values. 3) The change to a uint16 data type was discussed when CIM V2.0 was defined. However, existing V1.0 implementations used the string property and did not want to modify their code. Therefore, Status was grandfathered into the Schema. Use of the deprecated qualifier allows the maintenance of the existing property, but also permits an improved definition using OperationalStatus."

However, a few are not and are described here in more detail. 'Stressed' indicates that the element is functioning, but needs attention. Examples of 'Stressed' states are overload, overheated, and so on. 'Predictive Failure' indicates that an element is functioning nominally but predicting a failure in the near future. 'In Service' describes an element being configured, maintained, cleaned, or otherwise administered. 'No Contact' indicates that the monitoring system has knowledge of this element, but has never been able to establish communications with it. 'Lost Communication' indicates that the ManagedSystem Element is known to exist and has been contacted successfully in the past, but is currently unreachable. 'Stopped' and 'Aborted' are similar, although the former implies a clean and orderly stop, while the latter implies an abrupt stop where the state and configuration of the element might need to be updated. 'Dormant' indicates that the element is inactive or quiesced. 'Supporting Entity in Error' indicates that this element might be 'OK' but that another element, on which it is dependent, is in error. An example is a network service or endpoint that cannot function due to lower-layer networking problems. 'Completed' indicates that the element has completed its operation. This value should be combined with either OK, Error, or Degraded so that a client can tell if the complete operation Completed with OK (passed), Completed with Error (failed), or Completed with Degraded (the operation finished, but it did not complete OK or did not report an error). 'Power Mode' indicates that the element has additional power model information contained in the Associated PowerManagementService association. OperationalStatus replaces the Status property on ManagedSystemElement to provide a consistent approach to enumerations, to address implementation needs for an array property, and to provide a migration path from today's environment to the future. This change was not made earlier because it required the deprecated qualifier. Due to the widespread use of the existing Status property in management applications, it is strongly recommended that providers or instrumentation provide both the Status and OperationalStatus properties. Further, the first value of OperationalStatus should contain the primary status for the element. When instrumented, Status (because it is single-valued) should also provide the primary status of the element."

By default, the RequestedState of the element is 5 ('No Change'). Refer to the EnabledState property description for explanations of the values in the RequestedState enumeration. It should be noted that there are two new values in RequestedState that build on the statuses of EnabledState. These are 'Reboot' (10) and 'Reset' (11). Reboot refers to doing a 'Shut Down' and then moving to an 'Enabled' state. Reset indicates that the element is first 'Disabled' and then 'Enabled'. The distinction between requesting 'Shut Down' and 'Disabled' should also be noted. Shut Down requests an orderly transition to the Disabled state, and might involve removing power, to completely erase any existing state. The Disabled state requests an immediate disabling of the element, such that it will not execute or accept any commands or processing requests. This property is set as the result of a method invocation (such as Start or StopService on CIM_Service), or can be overridden and defined as WRITEable in a subclass. The method approach is considered superior to a WRITEable property, because it allows an explicit invocation of the operation and the return of a result code. A particular instance of EnabledLogicalElement might not support RequestedStateChange. If this occurs, the value 12 ('Not Applicable') is used."

This definition overcomes the limitation of describing status using a single value, when it is really a multi-valued property (for example, an element might be OK AND Stopped. 2) A MaxLen of 10 is too restrictive and leads to unclear enumerated values. 3) The change to a uint16 data type was discussed when CIM V2.0 was defined.

    "description": "Indicates the current statuses of the element. Various operational statuses are defined. Many of the enumeration's values are self-explanatory. However, a few are not and are described here in more detail. 'Stressed' indicates that the element is functioning, but needs attention. Examples of 'Stressed' states are overload, overheated, and so on. 'Predictive Failure' indicates that an element is functioning nominally but predicting a failure in the near future. 'In Service' describes an element being configured, maintained, cleaned, or otherwise administered. 'No Contact' indicates that the monitoring system has knowledge of this element, but has never been able to establish communications with it. 'Lost Communication' indicates that the ManagedSystem Element is known to exist and has been contacted successfully in the past, but is currently unreachable. 'Stopped' and 'Aborted' are similar, although the former implies a clean and orderly stop, while the latter implies an abrupt stop where the state and configuration of the element might need to be updated. 'Dormant' indicates that the element is inactive or quiesced. 'Supporting Entity in Error' indicates that this element might be 'OK' but that another element, on which it is dependent, is in error. An example is a network service or endpoint that cannot function due to lower-layer networking problems. 'Completed' indicates that the element has completed its operation. This value should be combined with either OK, Error, or Degraded so that a client can tell if the complete operation Completed with OK (passed), Completed with Error (failed), or Completed with Degraded (the operation finished, but it did not complete OK or did not report an error). 'Power Mode' indicates that the element has additional power model information contained in the Associated PowerManagementService association. OperationalStatus replaces the Status property on ManagedSystemElement to provide a consistent approach to enumerations, to address implementation needs for an array property, and to provide a migration path from today's environment to the future. This change was not made earlier because it required the deprecated qualifier. Due to the widespread use of the existing Status property in management applications, it is strongly recommended that providers or instrumentation provide both the Status and OperationalStatus properties. Further, the first value of OperationalStatus should contain the primary status for the element. When instrumented, Status (because it is single-valued) should also provide the primary status of the element."

This property is provided to compare the last requested and current enabled or disabled states. Note that when EnabledState is set to 5 ('Not Applicable'), then this property has no meaning. By default, the RequestedState of the element is 5 ('No Change'). Refer to the EnabledState property description for explanations of the values in the RequestedState enumeration. It should be noted that there are two new values in RequestedState that build on the statuses of EnabledState. These are 'Reboot' (10) and 'Reset' (11). Reboot refers to doing a 'Shut Down' and then moving to an 'Enabled' state. Reset indicates that the element is first 'Disabled' and then 'Enabled'. The distinction between requesting 'Shut Down' and 'Disabled' should also be noted. Shut Down requests an orderly transition to the Disabled state, and might involve removing power, to completely erase any existing state. The Disabled state requests an immediate disabling of the element, such that it will not execute or accept any commands or processing requests. This property is set as the result of a method invocation (such as Start or StopService on CIM_Service), or can be overridden and defined as WRITEable in a subclass. The method approach is considered superior to a WRITEable property, because it allows an explicit invocation of the operation and the return of a result code. A particular instance of EnabledLogicalElement might not support RequestedStateChange. If this occurs, the value 12 ('Not Applicable') is used."

This definition overcomes the limitation of describing status using a single value, when it is really a multi-valued property (for example, an element might be OK AND Stopped. 2) A MaxLen of 10 is too restrictive and leads to unclear enumerated values. 3) The change to a uint16 data type was discussed when CIM V2.0 was defined. However, existing V1.0 implementations used the string property and did not want to modify their code. Therefore, Status was grandfathered into the Schema. Use of the deprecated qualifier allows the maintenance of the existing property, but also permits an improved definition using OperationalStatus."

However, a few are not and are described here in more detail. 'Stressed' indicates that the element is functioning, but needs attention. Examples of 'Stressed' states are overload, overheated, and so on. 'Predictive Failure' indicates that an element is functioning nominally but predicting a failure in the near future. 'In Service' describes an element being configured, maintained, cleaned, or otherwise administered. 'No Contact' indicates that the monitoring system has knowledge of this element, but has never been able to establish communications with it. 'Lost Communication' indicates that the ManagedSystem Element is known to exist and has been contacted successfully in the past, but is currently unreachable. 'Stopped' and 'Aborted' are similar, although the former implies a clean and orderly stop, while the latter implies an abrupt stop where the state and configuration of the element might need to be updated. 'Dormant' indicates that the element is inactive or quiesced. 'Supporting Entity in Error' indicates that this element might be 'OK' but that another element, on which it is dependent, is in error. An example is a network service or endpoint that cannot function due to lower-layer networking problems. 'Completed' indicates that the element has completed its operation. This value should be combined with either OK, Error, or Degraded so that a client can tell if the complete operation Completed with OK (passed), Completed with Error (failed), or Completed with Degraded (the operation finished, but it did not complete OK or did not report an error). 'Power Mode' indicates that the element has additional power model information contained in the Associated PowerManagementService association. OperationalStatus replaces the Status property on ManagedSystemElement to provide a consistent approach to enumerations, to address implementation needs for an array property, and to provide a migration path from today's environment to the future. This change was not made earlier because it required the deprecated qualifier. Due to the widespread use of the existing Status property in management applications, it is strongly recommended that providers or instrumentation provide both the Status and OperationalStatus properties. Further, the first value of OperationalStatus should contain the primary status for the element. When instrumented, Status (because it is single-valued) should also provide the primary status of the element."

This property is provided to compare the last requested and current enabled or disabled states. Note that when EnabledState is set to 5 ('Not Applicable'), then this property has no meaning. By default, the RequestedState of the element is 5 ('No Change'). Refer to the EnabledState property description for explanations of the values in the RequestedState enumeration. It should be noted that there are two new values in RequestedState that build on the statuses of EnabledState. These are 'Reboot' (10) and 'Reset' (11). Reboot refers to doing a 'Shut Down' and then moving to an 'Enabled' state. Reset indicates that the element is first 'Disabled' and then 'Enabled'. The distinction between requesting 'Shut Down' and 'Disabled' should also be noted. Shut Down requests an orderly transition to the Disabled state, and might involve removing power, to completely erase any existing state. The Disabled state requests an immediate disabling of the element, such that it will not execute or accept any commands or processing requests. This property is set as the result of a method invocation (such as Start or StopService on CIM_Service), or can be overridden and defined as WRITEable in a subclass. The method approach is considered superior to a WRITEable property, because it allows an explicit invocation of the operation and the return of a result code. A particular instance of EnabledLogicalElement might not support RequestedStateChange. If this occurs, the value 12 ('Not Applicable') is used."

This property is deprecated in lieu of OperationalStatus, which includes the same semantics in its enumeration. This change is made for 3 reasons: 1) Status is more correctly defined as an array. This definition overcomes the limitation of describing status using a single value, when it is really a multi-valued property (for example, an element might be OK AND Stopped. 2) A MaxLen of 10 is too restrictive and leads to unclear enumerated values. 3) The change to a uint16 data type was discussed when CIM V2.0 was defined. However, existing V1.0 implementations used the string property and did not want to modify their code. Therefore, Status was grandfathered into the Schema. Use of the deprecated qualifier allows the maintenance of the existing property, but also permits an improved definition using OperationalStatus."

However, a few are not and are described here in more detail. 'Stressed' indicates that the element is functioning, but needs attention. Examples of 'Stressed' states are overload, overheated, and so on. 'Predictive Failure' indicates that an element is functioning nominally but predicting a failure in the near future. 'In Service' describes an element being configured, maintained, cleaned, or otherwise administered. 'No Contact' indicates that the monitoring system has knowledge of this element, but has never been able to establish communications with it. 'Lost Communication' indicates that the ManagedSystem Element is known to exist and has been contacted successfully in the past, but is currently unreachable. 'Stopped' and 'Aborted' are similar, although the former implies a clean and orderly stop, while the latter implies an abrupt stop where the state and configuration of the element might need to be updated. 'Dormant' indicates that the element is inactive or quiesced. 'Supporting Entity in Error' indicates that this element might be 'OK' but that another element, on which it is dependent, is in error. An example is a network service or endpoint that cannot function due to lower-layer networking problems. 'Completed' indicates that the element has completed its operation. This value should be combined with either OK, Error, or Degraded so that a client can tell if the complete operation Completed with OK (passed), Completed with Error (failed), or Completed with Degraded (the operation finished, but it did not complete OK or did not report an error). 'Power Mode' indicates that the element has additional power model information contained in the Associated PowerManagementService association. OperationalStatus replaces the Status property on ManagedSystemElement to provide a consistent approach to enumerations, to address implementation needs for an array property, and to provide a migration path from today's environment to the future. This change was not made earlier because it required the deprecated qualifier. Due to the widespread use of the existing Status property in management applications, it is strongly recommended that providers or instrumentation provide both the Status and OperationalStatus properties. Further, the first value of OperationalStatus should contain the primary status for the element. When instrumented, Status (because it is single-valued) should also provide the primary status of the element."

By default, the RequestedState of the element is 5 ('No Change'). Refer to the EnabledState property description for explanations of the values in the RequestedState enumeration. It should be noted that there are two new values in RequestedState that build on the statuses of EnabledState. These are 'Reboot' (10) and 'Reset' (11). Reboot refers to doing a 'Shut Down' and then moving to an 'Enabled' state. Reset indicates that the element is first 'Disabled' and then 'Enabled'. The distinction between requesting 'Shut Down' and 'Disabled' should also be noted. Shut Down requests an orderly transition to the Disabled state, and might involve removing power, to completely erase any existing state. The Disabled state requests an immediate disabling of the element, such that it will not execute or accept any commands or processing requests. This property is set as the result of a method invocation (such as Start or StopService on CIM_Service), or can be overridden and defined as WRITEable in a subclass. The method approach is considered superior to a WRITEable property, because it allows an explicit invocation of the operation and the return of a result code. A particular instance of EnabledLogicalElement might not support RequestedStateChange. If this occurs, the value 12 ('Not Applicable') is used."

This definition overcomes the limitation of describing status using a single value, when it is really a multi-valued property (for example, an element might be OK AND Stopped. 2) A MaxLen of 10 is too restrictive and leads to unclear enumerated values. 3) The change to a uint16 data type was discussed when CIM V2.0 was defined. However, existing V1.0 implementations used the string property and did not want to modify their code. Therefore, Status was grandfathered into the Schema.

Examples of 'Stressed' states are overload, overheated, and so on. 'Predictive Failure' indicates that an element is functioning nominally but predicting a failure in the near future. 'In Service' describes an element being configured, maintained, cleaned, or otherwise administered. 'No Contact' indicates that the monitoring system has knowledge of this element, but has never been able to establish communications with it. 'Lost Communication' indicates that the ManagedSystem Element is known to exist and has been contacted successfully in the past, but is currently unreachable. 'Stopped' and 'Aborted' are similar, although the former implies a clean and orderly stop, while the latter implies an abrupt stop where the state and configuration of the element might need to be updated. 'Dormant' indicates that the element is inactive or quiesced. 'Supporting Entity in Error' indicates that this element might be 'OK' but that another element, on which it is dependent, is in error. An example is a network service or endpoint that cannot function due to lower-layer networking problems. 'Completed' indicates that the element has completed its operation. This value should be combined with either OK, Error, or Degraded so that a client can tell if the complete operation Completed with OK (passed), Completed with Error (failed), or Completed with Degraded (the operation finished, but it did not complete OK or did not report an error). 'Power Mode' indicates that the element has additional power model information contained in the Associated PowerManagementService association. OperationalStatus replaces the Status property on ManagedSystemElement to provide a consistent approach to enumerations, to address implementation needs for an array property, and to provide a migration path from today's environment to the future. This change was not made earlier because it required the deprecated qualifier. Due to the widespread use of the existing Status property in management applications, it is strongly recommended that providers or instrumentation provide both the Status and OperationalStatus properties. Further, the first value of OperationalStatus should contain the primary status for the element. When instrumented, Status (because it is single-valued) should also provide the primary status of the element."

This property is provided to compare the last requested and current enabled or disabled states. Note that when EnabledState is set to 5 ('Not Applicable'), then this property has no meaning. By default, the RequestedState of the element is 5 ('No Change'). Refer to the EnabledState property description for explanations of the values in the RequestedState enumeration. It should be noted that there are two new values in RequestedState that build on the statuses of EnabledState. These are 'Reboot' (10) and 'Reset' (11). Reboot refers to doing a 'Shut Down' and then moving to an 'Enabled' state. Reset indicates that the element is first 'Disabled' and then 'Enabled'. The distinction between requesting 'Shut Down' and 'Disabled' should also be noted. Shut Down requests an orderly transition to the Disabled state, and might involve removing power, to completely erase any existing state. The Disabled state requests an immediate disabling of the element, such that it will not execute or accept any commands or processing requests. This property is set as the result of a method invocation (such as Start or StopService on CIM_Service), or can be overridden and defined as WRITEable in a subclass. The method approach is considered superior to a WRITEable property, because it allows an explicit invocation of the operation and the return of a result code. A particular instance of EnabledLogicalElement might not support RequestedStateChange. If this occurs, the value 12 ('Not Applicable') is used."

This property is deprecated in lieu of OperationalStatus, which includes the same semantics in its enumeration. This change is made for 3 reasons: 1) Status is more correctly defined as an array. This definition overcomes the limitation of describing status using a single value, when it is really a multi-valued property (for example, an element might be OK AND Stopped. 2) A MaxLen of 10 is too restrictive and leads to unclear enumerated values. 3) The change to a uint16 data type was discussed when CIM V2.0 was defined. However, existing V1.0 implementations used the string property and did not want to modify their code. Therefore, Status was grandfathered into the Schema. Use of the deprecated qualifier allows the maintenance of the existing property, but also permits an improved definition using OperationalStatus."

This decision will be re-evaluated and repositioned later. Deprecated description: Maximum time, in milliseconds, that a Device can run in a 'Quiesced' state. The state is defined in its Availability and AdditionalAvailability properties, where 'Quiesced' is conveyed by the value 21. What occurs at the end of the time limit is device-specific. The Device can unquiesce, can be offline, or can take other actions. A value of 0 indicates that a Device can remain quiesced indefinitely."

    "description": "Indicates the current statuses of the element. Various operational statuses are defined. Many of the enumeration's values are self-explanatory. However, a few are not and are described here in more detail. 'Stressed' indicates that the element is functioning, but needs attention. Examples of 'Stressed' states are overload, overheated, and so on. 'Predictive Failure' indicates that an element is functioning nominally but predicting a failure in the near future. 'In Service' describes an element being configured, maintained, cleaned, or otherwise administered. 'No Contact' indicates that the monitoring system has knowledge of this element, but has never been able to establish communications with it. 'Lost Communication' indicates that the ManagedSystem Element is known to exist and has been contacted successfully in the past, but is currently unreachable. 'Stopped' and 'Aborted' are similar, although the former implies a clean and orderly stop, while the latter implies an abrupt stop where the state and configuration of the element might need to be updated. 'Dormant' indicates that the element is inactive or quiesced. 'Supporting Entity in Error' indicates that this element might be 'OK' but that another element, on which it is dependent, is in error. An example is a network service or endpoint that cannot function due to lower-layer networking problems. 'Completed' indicates that the element has completed its operation. This value should be combined with either OK, Error, or Degraded so that a client can tell if the complete operation Completed with OK (passed), Completed with Error (failed), or Completed with Degraded (the operation finished, but it did not complete OK or did not report an error). 'Power Mode' indicates that the element has additional power model information contained in the Associated PowerManagementService association. OperationalStatus replaces the Status property on ManagedSystemElement to provide a consistent approach to enumerations, to address implementation needs for an array property, and to provide a migration path from today's environment to the future. This change was not made earlier because it required the deprecated qualifier. Due to the widespread use of the existing Status property in management applications, it is strongly recommended that providers or instrumentation provide both the Status and OperationalStatus properties. Further, the first value of OperationalStatus should contain the primary status for the element. When instrumented, Status (because it is single-valued) should also provide the primary status of the element."

By default, the RequestedState of the element is 5 ('No Change'). Refer to the EnabledState property description for explanations of the values in the RequestedState enumeration. It should be noted that there are two new values in RequestedState that build on the statuses of EnabledState. These are 'Reboot' (10) and 'Reset' (11). Reboot refers to doing a 'Shut Down' and then moving to an 'Enabled' state. Reset indicates that the element is first 'Disabled' and then 'Enabled'. The distinction between requesting 'Shut Down' and 'Disabled' should also be noted. Shut Down requests an orderly transition to the Disabled state, and might involve removing power, to completely erase any existing state. The Disabled state requests an immediate disabling of the element, such that it will not execute or accept any commands or processing requests. This property is set as the result of a method invocation (such as Start or StopService on CIM_Service), or can be overridden and defined as WRITEable in a subclass. The method approach is considered superior to a WRITEable property, because it allows an explicit invocation of the operation and the return of a result code. A particular instance of EnabledLogicalElement might not support RequestedStateChange. If this occurs, the value 12 ('Not Applicable') is used."

This definition overcomes the limitation of describing status using a single value, when it is really a multi-valued property (for example, an element might be OK AND Stopped. 2) A MaxLen of 10 is too restrictive and leads to unclear enumerated values. 3) The change to a uint16 data type was discussed when CIM V2.0 was defined. However, existing V1.0 implementations used the string property and did not want to modify their code. Therefore, Status was grandfathered into the Schema. Use of the deprecated qualifier allows the maintenance of the existing property, but also permits an improved definition using OperationalStatus."

Disabled (3) indicates that the element will not execute commands and will drop any new requests. Shutting Down (4) indicates that the element is in the process of going to a Disabled state. Not Applicable (5) indicates the element does not support being enabled or disabled. Enabled but Offline (6) indicates that the element might be completing commands, and will drop any new requests. Test (7) indicates that the element is in a test state. Deferred (8) indicates that the element might be completing commands, but will queue any new requests. Quiesce (9) indicates that the element is enabled but in a restricted mode. The behavior of the element is similar to the Enabled state, but it processes only a restricted set of commands. All other requests are queued. Starting (10) indicates that the element is in the process of going to an Enabled state. New requests are queued."

This property is deprecated in lieu of OperationalStatus, which includes the same semantics in its enumeration. This change is made for 3 reasons: 1) Status is more correctly defined as an array. This definition overcomes the limitation of describing status using a single value, when it is really a multi-valued property (for example, an element might be OK AND Stopped. 2) A MaxLen of 10 is too restrictive and leads to unclear enumerated values. 3) The change to a uint16 data type was discussed when CIM V2.0 was defined. However, existing V1.0 implementations used the string property and did not want to modify their code. Therefore, Status was grandfathered into the Schema. Use of the deprecated qualifier allows the maintenance of the existing property, but also permits an improved definition using OperationalStatus."

    "description": "Indicates the current statuses of the element. Various operational statuses are defined. Many of the enumeration's values are self-explanatory. However, a few are not and are described here in more detail. 'Stressed' indicates that the element is functioning, but needs attention. Examples of 'Stressed' states are overload, overheated, and so on. 'Predictive Failure' indicates that an element is functioning nominally but predicting a failure in the near future. 'In Service' describes an element being configured, maintained, cleaned, or otherwise administered. 'No Contact' indicates that the monitoring system has knowledge of this element, but has never been able to establish communications with it. 'Lost Communication' indicates that the ManagedSystem Element is known to exist and has been contacted successfully in the past, but is currently unreachable. 'Stopped' and 'Aborted' are similar, although the former implies a clean and orderly stop, while the latter implies an abrupt stop where the state and configuration of the element might need to be updated. 'Dormant' indicates that the element is inactive or quiesced. 'Supporting Entity in Error' indicates that this element might be 'OK' but that another element, on which it is dependent, is in error. An example is a network service or endpoint that cannot function due to lower-layer networking problems. 'Completed' indicates that the element has completed its operation. This value should be combined with either OK, Error, or Degraded so that a client can tell if the complete operation Completed with OK (passed), Completed with Error (failed), or Completed with Degraded (the operation finished, but it did not complete OK or did not report an error). 'Power Mode' indicates that the element has additional power model information contained in the Associated PowerManagementService association. OperationalStatus replaces the Status property on ManagedSystemElement to provide a consistent approach to enumerations, to address implementation needs for an array property, and to provide a migration path from today's environment to the future. This change was not made earlier because it required the deprecated qualifier. Due to the widespread use of the existing Status property in management applications, it is strongly recommended that providers or instrumentation provide both the Status and OperationalStatus properties. Further, the first value of OperationalStatus should contain the primary status for the element. When instrumented, Status (because it is single-valued) should also provide the primary status of the element."

To ensure uniqueness within the NameSpace, the value of InstanceID should be constructed using the following 'preferred' algorithm: <OrgID>:<LocalID> Where <OrgID> and <LocalID> are separated by a colon (:), and where <OrgID> must include a copyrighted, trademarked, or otherwise unique name that is owned by the business entity that is creating or defining the InstanceID or that is a registered ID assigned to the business entity by a recognized global authority. (This requirement is similar to the <Schema Name>_<Class Name> structure of Schema class names.) In addition, to ensure uniqueness, <OrgID> must not contain a colon (:). When using this algorithm, the first colon to appear in InstanceID must appear between <OrgID> and <LocalID>. <LocalID> is chosen by the business entity and should not be reused to identify different underlying (real-world) elements. If the above 'preferred' algorithm is not used, the defining entity must assure that the resulting InstanceID is not reused across any InstanceIDs produced by this or other providers for the NameSpace of this instance. For DMTF-defined instances, the 'preferred' algorithm must be used with the <OrgID> set to CIM."

However, a few are not and are described here in more detail. 'Stressed' indicates that the element is functioning, but needs attention. Examples of 'Stressed' states are overload, overheated, and so on. 'Predictive Failure' indicates that an element is functioning nominally but predicting a failure in the near future. 'In Service' describes an element being configured, maintained, cleaned, or otherwise administered. 'No Contact' indicates that the monitoring system has knowledge of this element, but has never been able to establish communications with it. 'Lost Communication' indicates that the ManagedSystem Element is known to exist and has been contacted successfully in the past, but is currently unreachable. 'Stopped' and 'Aborted' are similar, although the former implies a clean and orderly stop, while the latter implies an abrupt stop where the state and configuration of the element might need to be updated. 'Dormant' indicates that the element is inactive or quiesced. 'Supporting Entity in Error' indicates that this element might be 'OK' but that another element, on which it is dependent, is in error. An example is a network service or endpoint that cannot function due to lower-layer networking problems. 'Completed' indicates that the element has completed its operation. This value should be combined with either OK, Error, or Degraded so that a client can tell if the complete operation Completed with OK (passed), Completed with Error (failed), or Completed with Degraded (the operation finished, but it did not complete OK or did not report an error). 'Power Mode' indicates that the element has additional power model information contained in the Associated PowerManagementService association. OperationalStatus replaces the Status property on ManagedSystemElement to provide a consistent approach to enumerations, to address implementation needs for an array property, and to provide a migration path from today's environment to the future. This change was not made earlier because it required the deprecated qualifier. Due to the widespread use of the existing Status property in management applications, it is strongly recommended that providers or instrumentation provide both the Status and OperationalStatus properties. Further, the first value of OperationalStatus should contain the primary status for the element. When instrumented, Status (because it is single-valued) should also provide the primary status of the element."

This property is deprecated in lieu of OperationalStatus, which includes the same semantics in its enumeration. This change is made for 3 reasons: 1) Status is more correctly defined as an array. This definition overcomes the limitation of describing status using a single value, when it is really a multi-valued property (for example, an element might be OK AND Stopped. 2) A MaxLen of 10 is too restrictive and leads to unclear enumerated values. 3) The change to a uint16 data type was discussed when CIM V2.0 was defined. However, existing V1.0 implementations used the string property and did not want to modify their code. Therefore, Status was grandfathered into the Schema. Use of the deprecated qualifier allows the maintenance of the existing property, but also permits an improved definition using OperationalStatus."

    "description": "Indicates the current statuses of the element. Various operational statuses are defined. Many of the enumeration's values are self-explanatory. However, a few are not and are described here in more detail. 'Stressed' indicates that the element is functioning, but needs attention. Examples of 'Stressed' states are overload, overheated, and so on. 'Predictive Failure' indicates that an element is functioning nominally but predicting a failure in the near future. 'In Service' describes an element being configured, maintained, cleaned, or otherwise administered. 'No Contact' indicates that the monitoring system has knowledge of this element, but has never been able to establish communications with it. 'Lost Communication' indicates that the ManagedSystem Element is known to exist and has been contacted successfully in the past, but is currently unreachable. 'Stopped' and 'Aborted' are similar, although the former implies a clean and orderly stop, while the latter implies an abrupt stop where the state and configuration of the element might need to be updated. 'Dormant' indicates that the element is inactive or quiesced. 'Supporting Entity in Error' indicates that this element might be 'OK' but that another element, on which it is dependent, is in error. An example is a network service or endpoint that cannot function due to lower-layer networking problems. 'Completed' indicates that the element has completed its operation. This value should be combined with either OK, Error, or Degraded so that a client can tell if the complete operation Completed with OK (passed), Completed with Error (failed), or Completed with Degraded (the operation finished, but it did not complete OK or did not report an error). 'Power Mode' indicates that the element has additional power model information contained in the Associated PowerManagementService association. OperationalStatus replaces the Status property on ManagedSystemElement to provide a consistent approach to enumerations, to address implementation needs for an array property, and to provide a migration path from today's environment to the future. This change was not made earlier because it required the deprecated qualifier. Due to the widespread use of the existing Status property in management applications, it is strongly recommended that providers or instrumentation provide both the Status and OperationalStatus properties. Further, the first value of OperationalStatus should contain the primary status for the element. When instrumented, Status (because it is single-valued) should also provide the primary status of the element."

By default, the RequestedState of the element is 5 ('No Change'). Refer to the EnabledState property description for explanations of the values in the RequestedState enumeration. It should be noted that there are two new values in RequestedState that build on the statuses of EnabledState. These are 'Reboot' (10) and 'Reset' (11). Reboot refers to doing a 'Shut Down' and then moving to an 'Enabled' state. Reset indicates that the element is first 'Disabled' and then 'Enabled'. The distinction between requesting 'Shut Down' and 'Disabled' should also be noted. Shut Down requests an orderly transition to the Disabled state, and might involve removing power, to completely erase any existing state. The Disabled state requests an immediate disabling of the element, such that it will not execute or accept any commands or processing requests. This property is set as the result of a method invocation (such as Start or StopService on CIM_Service), or can be overridden and defined as WRITEable in a subclass. The method approach is considered superior to a WRITEable property, because it allows an explicit invocation of the operation and the return of a result code. A particular instance of EnabledLogicalElement might not support RequestedStateChange. If this occurs, the value 12 ('Not Applicable') is used."

This definition overcomes the limitation of describing status using a single value, when it is really a multi-valued property (for example, an element might be OK AND Stopped. 2) A MaxLen of 10 is too restrictive and leads to unclear enumerated values. 3) The change to a uint16 data type was discussed when CIM V2.0 was defined. However, existing V1.0 implementations used the string property and did not want to modify their code. Therefore, Status was grandfathered into the Schema.

Examples of 'Stressed' states are overload, overheated, and so on. 'Predictive Failure' indicates that an element is functioning nominally but predicting a failure in the near future. 'In Service' describes an element being configured, maintained, cleaned, or otherwise administered. 'No Contact' indicates that the monitoring system has knowledge of this element, but has never been able to establish communications with it. 'Lost Communication' indicates that the ManagedSystem Element is known to exist and has been contacted successfully in the past, but is currently unreachable. 'Stopped' and 'Aborted' are similar, although the former implies a clean and orderly stop, while the latter implies an abrupt stop where the state and configuration of the element might need to be updated. 'Dormant' indicates that the element is inactive or quiesced. 'Supporting Entity in Error' indicates that this element might be 'OK' but that another element, on which it is dependent, is in error. An example is a network service or endpoint that cannot function due to lower-layer networking problems. 'Completed' indicates that the element has completed its operation. This value should be combined with either OK, Error, or Degraded so that a client can tell if the complete operation Completed with OK (passed), Completed with Error (failed), or Completed with Degraded (the operation finished, but it did not complete OK or did not report an error). 'Power Mode' indicates that the element has additional power model information contained in the Associated PowerManagementService association. OperationalStatus replaces the Status property on ManagedSystemElement to provide a consistent approach to enumerations, to address implementation needs for an array property, and to provide a migration path from today's environment to the future. This change was not made earlier because it required the deprecated qualifier. Due to the widespread use of the existing Status property in management applications, it is strongly recommended that providers or instrumentation provide both the Status and OperationalStatus properties. Further, the first value of OperationalStatus should contain the primary status for the element. When instrumented, Status (because it is single-valued) should also provide the primary status of the element."

By default, the RequestedState of the element is 5 ('No Change'). Refer to the EnabledState property description for explanations of the values in the RequestedState enumeration. It should be noted that there are two new values in RequestedState that build on the statuses of EnabledState. These are 'Reboot' (10) and 'Reset' (11). Reboot refers to doing a 'Shut Down' and then moving to an 'Enabled' state. Reset indicates that the element is first 'Disabled' and then 'Enabled'. The distinction between requesting 'Shut Down' and 'Disabled' should also be noted. Shut Down requests an orderly transition to the Disabled state, and might involve removing power, to completely erase any existing state. The Disabled state requests an immediate disabling of the element, such that it will not execute or accept any commands or processing requests. This property is set as the result of a method invocation (such as Start or StopService on CIM_Service), or can be overridden and defined as WRITEable in a subclass. The method approach is considered superior to a WRITEable property, because it allows an explicit invocation of the operation and the return of a result code.

This definition overcomes the limitation of describing status using a single value, when it is really a multi-valued property (for example, an element might be OK AND Stopped. 2) A MaxLen of 10 is too restrictive and leads to unclear enumerated values. 3) The change to a uint16 data type was discussed when CIM V2.0 was defined.

The following text briefly summarizes the various enabled and disabled states: Enabled (2) indicates that the element is or could be executing commands, will process any queued commands, and queues new requests. Disabled (3) indicates that the element will not execute commands and will drop any new requests. Shutting Down (4) indicates that the element is in the process of going to a Disabled state. Not Applicable (5) indicates the element does not support being enabled or disabled. Enabled but Offline (6) indicates that the element might be completing commands, and will drop any new requests. Test (7) indicates that the element is in a test state. Deferred (8) indicates that the element might be completing commands, but will queue any new requests. Quiesce (9) indicates that the element is enabled but in a restricted mode. The behavior of the element is similar to the Enabled state, but it processes only a restricted set of commands. All other requests are queued. Starting (10) indicates that the element is in the process of going to an Enabled state. New requests are queued."

However, a few are not and are described here in more detail. 'Stressed' indicates that the element is functioning, but needs attention. Examples of 'Stressed' states are overload, overheated, and so on. 'Predictive Failure' indicates that an element is functioning nominally but predicting a failure in the near future. 'In Service' describes an element being configured, maintained, cleaned, or otherwise administered. 'No Contact' indicates that the monitoring system has knowledge of this element, but has never been able to establish communications with it. 'Lost Communication' indicates that the ManagedSystem Element is known to exist and has been contacted successfully in the past, but is currently unreachable. 'Stopped' and 'Aborted' are similar, although the former implies a clean and orderly stop, while the latter implies an abrupt stop where the state and configuration of the element might need to be updated. 'Dormant' indicates that the element is inactive or quiesced. 'Supporting Entity in Error' indicates that this element might be 'OK' but that another element, on which it is dependent, is in error. An example is a network service or endpoint that cannot function due to lower-layer networking problems. 'Completed' indicates that the element has completed its operation. This value should be combined with either OK, Error, or Degraded so that a client can tell if the complete operation Completed with OK (passed), Completed with Error (failed), or Completed with Degraded (the operation finished, but it did not complete OK or did not report an error). 'Power Mode' indicates that the element has additional power model information contained in the Associated PowerManagementService association. OperationalStatus replaces the Status property on ManagedSystemElement to provide a consistent approach to enumerations, to address implementation needs for an array property, and to provide a migration path from today's environment to the future. This change was not made earlier because it required the deprecated qualifier. Due to the widespread use of the existing Status property in management applications, it is strongly recommended that providers or instrumentation provide both the Status and OperationalStatus properties. Further, the first value of OperationalStatus should contain the primary status for the element. When instrumented, Status (because it is single-valued) should also provide the primary status of the element."

This property is provided to compare the last requested and current enabled or disabled states. Note that when EnabledState is set to 5 ('Not Applicable'), then this property has no meaning. By default, the RequestedState of the element is 5 ('No Change'). Refer to the EnabledState property description for explanations of the values in the RequestedState enumeration. It should be noted that there are two new values in RequestedState that build on the statuses of EnabledState. These are 'Reboot' (10) and 'Reset' (11). Reboot refers to doing a 'Shut Down' and then moving to an 'Enabled' state. Reset indicates that the element is first 'Disabled' and then 'Enabled'. The distinction between requesting 'Shut Down' and 'Disabled' should also be noted. Shut Down requests an orderly transition to the Disabled state, and might involve removing power, to completely erase any existing state. The Disabled state requests an immediate disabling of the element, such that it will not execute or accept any commands or processing requests. This property is set as the result of a method invocation (such as Start or StopService on CIM_Service), or can be overridden and defined as WRITEable in a subclass. The method approach is considered superior to a WRITEable property, because it allows an explicit invocation of the operation and the return of a result code. A particular instance of EnabledLogicalElement might not support RequestedStateChange. If this occurs, the value 12 ('Not Applicable') is used."

This definition overcomes the limitation of describing status using a single value, when it is really a multi-valued property (for example, an element might be OK AND Stopped. 2) A MaxLen of 10 is too restrictive and leads to unclear enumerated values. 3) The change to a uint16 data type was discussed when CIM V2.0 was defined. However, existing V1.0 implementations used the string property and did not want to modify their code. Therefore, Status was grandfathered into the Schema. Use of the deprecated qualifier allows the maintenance of the existing property, but also permits an improved definition using OperationalStatus."

'Critical Failure' (25) - The element is non-functional and recovery might not be possible. 'Major Failure' (20) - The element is failing. It is possible that some or all of the functionality of this component is degraded or not working. 'Minor Failure' (15) - All functionality is available but some might be degraded. 'Degraded/Warning' (10) - The element is in working order and all functionality is provided. However, the element is not working to the best of its abilities. For example, the element might not be operating at optimal performance or it might be reporting recoverable errors. 'OK' (5) - The element is fully functional and is operating within normal operational parameters and without error. 'Unknown' (0) - The implementation cannot report on HealthState at this time.

However, a few are not and are described here in more detail. 'Stressed' indicates that the element is functioning, but needs attention. Examples of 'Stressed' states are overload, overheated, and so on. 'Predictive Failure' indicates that an element is functioning nominally but predicting a failure in the near future. 'In Service' describes an element being configured, maintained, cleaned, or otherwise administered. 'No Contact' indicates that the monitoring system has knowledge of this element, but has never been able to establish communications with it. 'Lost Communication' indicates that the ManagedSystem Element is known to exist and has been contacted successfully in the past, but is currently unreachable. 'Stopped' and 'Aborted' are similar, although the former implies a clean and orderly stop, while the latter implies an abrupt stop where the state and configuration of the element might need to be updated. 'Dormant' indicates that the element is inactive or quiesced. 'Supporting Entity in Error' indicates that this element might be 'OK' but that another element, on which it is dependent, is in error. An example is a network service or endpoint that cannot function due to lower-layer networking problems. 'Completed' indicates that the element has completed its operation. This value should be combined with either OK, Error, or Degraded so that a client can tell if the complete operation Completed with OK (passed), Completed with Error (failed), or Completed with Degraded (the operation finished, but it did not complete OK or did not report an error). 'Power Mode' indicates that the element has additional power model information contained in the Associated PowerManagementService association. OperationalStatus replaces the Status property on ManagedSystemElement to provide a consistent approach to enumerations, to address implementation needs for an array property, and to provide a migration path from today's environment to the future. This change was not made earlier because it required the deprecated qualifier. Due to the widespread use of the existing Status property in management applications, it is strongly recommended that providers or instrumentation provide both the Status and OperationalStatus properties. Further, the first value of OperationalStatus should contain the primary status for the element. When instrumented, Status (because it is single-valued) should also provide the primary status of the element."

By default, the RequestedState of the element is 5 ('No Change'). Refer to the EnabledState property description for explanations of the values in the RequestedState enumeration. It should be noted that there are two new values in RequestedState that build on the statuses of EnabledState. These are 'Reboot' (10) and 'Reset' (11). Reboot refers to doing a 'Shut Down' and then moving to an 'Enabled' state. Reset indicates that the element is first 'Disabled' and then 'Enabled'. The distinction between requesting 'Shut Down' and 'Disabled' should also be noted. Shut Down requests an orderly transition to the Disabled state, and might involve removing power, to completely erase any existing state. The Disabled state requests an immediate disabling of the element, such that it will not execute or accept any commands or processing requests. This property is set as the result of a method invocation (such as Start or StopService on CIM_Service), or can be overridden and defined as WRITEable in a subclass. The method approach is considered superior to a WRITEable property, because it allows an explicit invocation of the operation and the return of a result code. A particular instance of EnabledLogicalElement might not support RequestedStateChange. If this occurs, the value 12 ('Not Applicable') is used."

This definition overcomes the limitation of describing status using a single value, when it is really a multi-valued property (for example, an element might be OK AND Stopped. 2) A MaxLen of 10 is too restrictive and leads to unclear enumerated values. 3) The change to a uint16 data type was discussed when CIM V2.0 was defined. However, existing V1.0 implementations used the string property and did not want to modify their code. Therefore, Status was grandfathered into the Schema.

However, if it is single use, then the flag is automatically cleared after the settings are applied. Also note that if this flag is specified (i.e. set to value other than 'Unknown'), then this takes precedence over any SettingData that may have been specified as Default. For example: If the managed element is a computer system, and the value of this flag is 'Is Next', then the setting will be effective next time the system resets. And, unless this flag is changed, it will persist for subsequent system resets. However, if this flag is set to 'Is Next For Single Use', then this setting will only be used once and the flag would be reset after that to 'Is Not Next'.

However, a few are not and are described here in more detail. 'Stressed' indicates that the element is functioning, but needs attention. Examples of 'Stressed' states are overload, overheated, and so on. 'Predictive Failure' indicates that an element is functioning nominally but predicting a failure in the near future. 'In Service' describes an element being configured, maintained, cleaned, or otherwise administered. 'No Contact' indicates that the monitoring system has knowledge of this element, but has never been able to establish communications with it. 'Lost Communication' indicates that the ManagedSystem Element is known to exist and has been contacted successfully in the past, but is currently unreachable. 'Stopped' and 'Aborted' are similar, although the former implies a clean and orderly stop, while the latter implies an abrupt stop where the state and configuration of the element might need to be updated. 'Dormant' indicates that the element is inactive or quiesced. 'Supporting Entity in Error' indicates that this element might be 'OK' but that another element, on which it is dependent, is in error. An example is a network service or endpoint that cannot function due to lower-layer networking problems. 'Completed' indicates that the element has completed its operation. This value should be combined with either OK, Error, or Degraded so that a client can tell if the complete operation Completed with OK (passed), Completed with Error (failed), or Completed with Degraded (the operation finished, but it did not complete OK or did not report an error). 'Power Mode' indicates that the element has additional power model information contained in the Associated PowerManagementService association. OperationalStatus replaces the Status property on ManagedSystemElement to provide a consistent approach to enumerations, to address implementation needs for an array property, and to provide a migration path from today's environment to the future. This change was not made earlier because it required the deprecated qualifier. Due to the widespread use of the existing Status property in management applications, it is strongly recommended that providers or instrumentation provide both the Status and OperationalStatus properties. Further, the first value of OperationalStatus should contain the primary status for the element. When instrumented, Status (because it is single-valued) should also provide the primary status of the element."

However, a few are not and are described here in more detail. 'Stressed' indicates that the element is functioning, but needs attention. Examples of 'Stressed' states are overload, overheated, and so on. 'Predictive Failure' indicates that an element is functioning nominally but predicting a failure in the near future. 'In Service' describes an element being configured, maintained, cleaned, or otherwise administered. 'No Contact' indicates that the monitoring system has knowledge of this element, but has never been able to establish communications with it. 'Lost Communication' indicates that the ManagedSystem Element is known to exist and has been contacted successfully in the past, but is currently unreachable. 'Stopped' and 'Aborted' are similar, although the former implies a clean and orderly stop, while the latter implies an abrupt stop where the state and configuration of the element might need to be updated. 'Dormant' indicates that the element is inactive or quiesced. 'Supporting Entity in Error' indicates that this element might be 'OK' but that another element, on which it is dependent, is in error. An example is a network service or endpoint that cannot function due to lower-layer networking problems. 'Completed' indicates that the element has completed its operation. This value should be combined with either OK, Error, or Degraded so that a client can tell if the complete operation Completed with OK (passed), Completed with Error (failed), or Completed with Degraded (the operation finished, but it did not complete OK or did not report an error). 'Power Mode' indicates that the element has additional power model information contained in the Associated PowerManagementService association. OperationalStatus replaces the Status property on ManagedSystemElement to provide a consistent approach to enumerations, to address implementation needs for an array property, and to provide a migration path from today's environment to the future. This change was not made earlier because it required the deprecated qualifier. Due to the widespread use of the existing Status property in management applications, it is strongly recommended that providers or instrumentation provide both the Status and OperationalStatus properties. Further, the first value of OperationalStatus should contain the primary status for the element. When instrumented, Status (because it is single-valued) should also provide the primary status of the element."

This property is provided to compare the last requested and current enabled or disabled states. Note that when EnabledState is set to 5 ('Not Applicable'), then this property has no meaning. By default, the RequestedState of the element is 5 ('No Change'). Refer to the EnabledState property description for explanations of the values in the RequestedState enumeration. It should be noted that there are two new values in RequestedState that build on the statuses of EnabledState. These are 'Reboot' (10) and 'Reset' (11). Reboot refers to doing a 'Shut Down' and then moving to an 'Enabled' state. Reset indicates that the element is first 'Disabled' and then 'Enabled'. The distinction between requesting 'Shut Down' and 'Disabled' should also be noted. Shut Down requests an orderly transition to the Disabled state, and might involve removing power, to completely erase any existing state. The Disabled state requests an immediate disabling of the element, such that it will not execute or accept any commands or processing requests. This property is set as the result of a method invocation (such as Start or StopService on CIM_Service), or can be overridden and defined as WRITEable in a subclass. The method approach is considered superior to a WRITEable property, because it allows an explicit invocation of the operation and the return of a result code. A particular instance of EnabledLogicalElement might not support RequestedStateChange. If this occurs, the value 12 ('Not Applicable') is used."

This property is deprecated in lieu of OperationalStatus, which includes the same semantics in its enumeration. This change is made for 3 reasons: 1) Status is more correctly defined as an array. This definition overcomes the limitation of describing status using a single value, when it is really a multi-valued property (for example, an element might be OK AND Stopped. 2) A MaxLen of 10 is too restrictive and leads to unclear enumerated values. 3) The change to a uint16 data type was discussed when CIM V2.0 was defined. However, existing V1.0 implementations used the string property and did not want to modify their code. Therefore, Status was grandfathered into the Schema. Use of the deprecated qualifier allows the maintenance of the existing property, but also permits an improved definition using OperationalStatus."

    "description": "Indicates the current statuses of the element. Various operational statuses are defined. Many of the enumeration's values are self-explanatory. However, a few are not and are described here in more detail. 'Stressed' indicates that the element is functioning, but needs attention. Examples of 'Stressed' states are overload, overheated, and so on. 'Predictive Failure' indicates that an element is functioning nominally but predicting a failure in the near future. 'In Service' describes an element being configured, maintained, cleaned, or otherwise administered. 'No Contact' indicates that the monitoring system has knowledge of this element, but has never been able to establish communications with it. 'Lost Communication' indicates that the ManagedSystem Element is known to exist and has been contacted successfully in the past, but is currently unreachable. 'Stopped' and 'Aborted' are similar, although the former implies a clean and orderly stop, while the latter implies an abrupt stop where the state and configuration of the element might need to be updated. 'Dormant' indicates that the element is inactive or quiesced. 'Supporting Entity in Error' indicates that this element might be 'OK' but that another element, on which it is dependent, is in error. An example is a network service or endpoint that cannot function due to lower-layer networking problems. 'Completed' indicates that the element has completed its operation. This value should be combined with either OK, Error, or Degraded so that a client can tell if the complete operation Completed with OK (passed), Completed with Error (failed), or Completed with Degraded (the operation finished, but it did not complete OK or did not report an error). 'Power Mode' indicates that the element has additional power model information contained in the Associated PowerManagementService association. OperationalStatus replaces the Status property on ManagedSystemElement to provide a consistent approach to enumerations, to address implementation needs for an array property, and to provide a migration path from today's environment to the future. This change was not made earlier because it required the deprecated qualifier. Due to the widespread use of the existing Status property in management applications, it is strongly recommended that providers or instrumentation provide both the Status and OperationalStatus properties. Further, the first value of OperationalStatus should contain the primary status for the element. When instrumented, Status (because it is single-valued) should also provide the primary status of the element."

This property is provided to compare the last requested and current enabled or disabled states. Note that when EnabledState is set to 5 ('Not Applicable'), then this property has no meaning. By default, the RequestedState of the element is 5 ('No Change'). Refer to the EnabledState property description for explanations of the values in the RequestedState enumeration. It should be noted that there are two new values in RequestedState that build on the statuses of EnabledState. These are 'Reboot' (10) and 'Reset' (11). Reboot refers to doing a 'Shut Down' and then moving to an 'Enabled' state. Reset indicates that the element is first 'Disabled' and then 'Enabled'. The distinction between requesting 'Shut Down' and 'Disabled' should also be noted. Shut Down requests an orderly transition to the Disabled state, and might involve removing power, to completely erase any existing state. The Disabled state requests an immediate disabling of the element, such that it will not execute or accept any commands or processing requests. This property is set as the result of a method invocation (such as Start or StopService on CIM_Service), or can be overridden and defined as WRITEable in a subclass. The method approach is considered superior to a WRITEable property, because it allows an explicit invocation of the operation and the return of a result code. A particular instance of EnabledLogicalElement might not support RequestedStateChange. If this occurs, the value 12 ('Not Applicable') is used."

Examples of 'Stressed' states are overload, overheated, and so on. 'Predictive Failure' indicates that an element is functioning nominally but predicting a failure in the near future. 'In Service' describes an element being configured, maintained, cleaned, or otherwise administered. 'No Contact' indicates that the monitoring system has knowledge of this element, but has never been able to establish communications with it. 'Lost Communication' indicates that the ManagedSystem Element is known to exist and has been contacted successfully in the past, but is currently unreachable. 'Stopped' and 'Aborted' are similar, although the former implies a clean and orderly stop, while the latter implies an abrupt stop where the state and configuration of the element might need to be updated. 'Dormant' indicates that the element is inactive or quiesced. 'Supporting Entity in Error' indicates that this element might be 'OK' but that another element, on which it is dependent, is in error. An example is a network service or endpoint that cannot function due to lower-layer networking problems. 'Completed' indicates that the element has completed its operation. This value should be combined with either OK, Error, or Degraded so that a client can tell if the complete operation Completed with OK (passed), Completed with Error (failed), or Completed with Degraded (the operation finished, but it did not complete OK or did not report an error). 'Power Mode' indicates that the element has additional power model information contained in the Associated PowerManagementService association. OperationalStatus replaces the Status property on ManagedSystemElement to provide a consistent approach to enumerations, to address implementation needs for an array property, and to provide a migration path from today's environment to the future. This change was not made earlier because it required the deprecated qualifier. Due to the widespread use of the existing Status property in management applications, it is strongly recommended that providers or instrumentation provide both the Status and OperationalStatus properties. Further, the first value of OperationalStatus should contain the primary status for the element. When instrumented, Status (because it is single-valued) should also provide the primary status of the element."

By default, the RequestedState of the element is 5 ('No Change'). Refer to the EnabledState property description for explanations of the values in the RequestedState enumeration. It should be noted that there are two new values in RequestedState that build on the statuses of EnabledState. These are 'Reboot' (10) and 'Reset' (11). Reboot refers to doing a 'Shut Down' and then moving to an 'Enabled' state. Reset indicates that the element is first 'Disabled' and then 'Enabled'. The distinction between requesting 'Shut Down' and 'Disabled' should also be noted. Shut Down requests an orderly transition to the Disabled state, and might involve removing power, to completely erase any existing state. The Disabled state requests an immediate disabling of the element, such that it will not execute or accept any commands or processing requests. This property is set as the result of a method invocation (such as Start or StopService on CIM_Service), or can be overridden and defined as WRITEable in a subclass. The method approach is considered superior to a WRITEable property, because it allows an explicit invocation of the operation and the return of a result code.

This definition overcomes the limitation of describing status using a single value, when it is really a multi-valued property (for example, an element might be OK AND Stopped. 2) A MaxLen of 10 is too restrictive and leads to unclear enumerated values. 3) The change to a uint16 data type was discussed when CIM V2.0 was defined.

However, a few are not and are described here in more detail. 'Stressed' indicates that the element is functioning, but needs attention. Examples of 'Stressed' states are overload, overheated, and so on. 'Predictive Failure' indicates that an element is functioning nominally but predicting a failure in the near future. 'In Service' describes an element being configured, maintained, cleaned, or otherwise administered. 'No Contact' indicates that the monitoring system has knowledge of this element, but has never been able to establish communications with it. 'Lost Communication' indicates that the ManagedSystem Element is known to exist and has been contacted successfully in the past, but is currently unreachable. 'Stopped' and 'Aborted' are similar, although the former implies a clean and orderly stop, while the latter implies an abrupt stop where the state and configuration of the element might need to be updated. 'Dormant' indicates that the element is inactive or quiesced. 'Supporting Entity in Error' indicates that this element might be 'OK' but that another element, on which it is dependent, is in error. An example is a network service or endpoint that cannot function due to lower-layer networking problems. 'Completed' indicates that the element has completed its operation. This value should be combined with either OK, Error, or Degraded so that a client can tell if the complete operation Completed with OK (passed), Completed with Error (failed), or Completed with Degraded (the operation finished, but it did not complete OK or did not report an error). 'Power Mode' indicates that the element has additional power model information contained in the Associated PowerManagementService association. OperationalStatus replaces the Status property on ManagedSystemElement to provide a consistent approach to enumerations, to address implementation needs for an array property, and to provide a migration path from today's environment to the future. This change was not made earlier because it required the deprecated qualifier. Due to the widespread use of the existing Status property in management applications, it is strongly recommended that providers or instrumentation provide both the Status and OperationalStatus properties. Further, the first value of OperationalStatus should contain the primary status for the element. When instrumented, Status (because it is single-valued) should also provide the primary status of the element."

By default, the RequestedState of the element is 5 ('No Change'). Refer to the EnabledState property description for explanations of the values in the RequestedState enumeration. It should be noted that there are two new values in RequestedState that build on the statuses of EnabledState. These are 'Reboot' (10) and 'Reset' (11). Reboot refers to doing a 'Shut Down' and then moving to an 'Enabled' state. Reset indicates that the element is first 'Disabled' and then 'Enabled'. The distinction between requesting 'Shut Down' and 'Disabled' should also be noted. Shut Down requests an orderly transition to the Disabled state, and might involve removing power, to completely erase any existing state. The Disabled state requests an immediate disabling of the element, such that it will not execute or accept any commands or processing requests. This property is set as the result of a method invocation (such as Start or StopService on CIM_Service), or can be overridden and defined as WRITEable in a subclass. The method approach is considered superior to a WRITEable property, because it allows an explicit invocation of the operation and the return of a result code. A particular instance of EnabledLogicalElement might not support RequestedStateChange. If this occurs, the value 12 ('Not Applicable') is used."

However, existing V1.0 implementations used the string property and did not want to modify their code. Therefore, Status was grandfathered into the Schema. Use of the deprecated qualifier allows the maintenance of the existing property, but also permits an improved definition using OperationalStatus."

Examples of 'Stressed' states are overload, overheated, and so on. 'Predictive Failure' indicates that an element is functioning nominally but predicting a failure in the near future. 'In Service' describes an element being configured, maintained, cleaned, or otherwise administered. 'No Contact' indicates that the monitoring system has knowledge of this element, but has never been able to establish communications with it. 'Lost Communication' indicates that the ManagedSystem Element is known to exist and has been contacted successfully in the past, but is currently unreachable. 'Stopped' and 'Aborted' are similar, although the former implies a clean and orderly stop, while the latter implies an abrupt stop where the state and configuration of the element might need to be updated. 'Dormant' indicates that the element is inactive or quiesced. 'Supporting Entity in Error' indicates that this element might be 'OK' but that another element, on which it is dependent, is in error. An example is a network service or endpoint that cannot function due to lower-layer networking problems. 'Completed' indicates that the element has completed its operation. This value should be combined with either OK, Error, or Degraded so that a client can tell if the complete operation Completed with OK (passed), Completed with Error (failed), or Completed with Degraded (the operation finished, but it did not complete OK or did not report an error). 'Power Mode' indicates that the element has additional power model information contained in the Associated PowerManagementService association. OperationalStatus replaces the Status property on ManagedSystemElement to provide a consistent approach to enumerations, to address implementation needs for an array property, and to provide a migration path from today's environment to the future. This change was not made earlier because it required the deprecated qualifier. Due to the widespread use of the existing Status property in management applications, it is strongly recommended that providers or instrumentation provide both the Status and OperationalStatus properties. Further, the first value of OperationalStatus should contain the primary status for the element. When instrumented, Status (because it is single-valued) should also provide the primary status of the element."

This property is provided to compare the last requested and current enabled or disabled states. Note that when EnabledState is set to 5 ('Not Applicable'), then this property has no meaning. By default, the RequestedState of the element is 5 ('No Change'). Refer to the EnabledState property description for explanations of the values in the RequestedState enumeration. It should be noted that there are two new values in RequestedState that build on the statuses of EnabledState. These are 'Reboot' (10) and 'Reset' (11). Reboot refers to doing a 'Shut Down' and then moving to an 'Enabled' state. Reset indicates that the element is first 'Disabled' and then 'Enabled'. The distinction between requesting 'Shut Down' and 'Disabled' should also be noted. Shut Down requests an orderly transition to the Disabled state, and might involve removing power, to completely erase any existing state. The Disabled state requests an immediate disabling of the element, such that it will not execute or accept any commands or processing requests. This property is set as the result of a method invocation (such as Start or StopService on CIM_Service), or can be overridden and defined as WRITEable in a subclass. The method approach is considered superior to a WRITEable property, because it allows an explicit invocation of the operation and the return of a result code. A particular instance of EnabledLogicalElement might not support RequestedStateChange. If this occurs, the value 12 ('Not Applicable') is used."

The endpoint becomes a trunk interface even if the neighboring interface is not a trunk interface. - Dot1Q Tunnel: Configures the interface as a tunnel (nontrunking) endpoint/port to be connected in an asymmetric link with an 802.1Q trunk port. 802.1Q tunneling is used to maintain customer VLAN integrity across a service provider network."

    "description": "Indicates the current statuses of the element. Various operational statuses are defined. Many of the enumeration's values are self-explanatory. However, a few are not and are described here in more detail. 'Stressed' indicates that the element is functioning, but needs attention. Examples of 'Stressed' states are overload, overheated, and so on. 'Predictive Failure' indicates that an element is functioning nominally but predicting a failure in the near future. 'In Service' describes an element being configured, maintained, cleaned, or otherwise administered. 'No Contact' indicates that the monitoring system has knowledge of this element, but has never been able to establish communications with it. 'Lost Communication' indicates that the ManagedSystem Element is known to exist and has been contacted successfully in the past, but is currently unreachable. 'Stopped' and 'Aborted' are similar, although the former implies a clean and orderly stop, while the latter implies an abrupt stop where the state and configuration of the element might need to be updated. 'Dormant' indicates that the element is inactive or quiesced. 'Supporting Entity in Error' indicates that this element might be 'OK' but that another element, on which it is dependent, is in error. An example is a network service or endpoint that cannot function due to lower-layer networking problems. 'Completed' indicates that the element has completed its operation. This value should be combined with either OK, Error, or Degraded so that a client can tell if the complete operation Completed with OK (passed), Completed with Error (failed), or Completed with Degraded (the operation finished, but it did not complete OK or did not report an error). 'Power Mode' indicates that the element has additional power model information contained in the Associated PowerManagementService association. OperationalStatus replaces the Status property on ManagedSystemElement to provide a consistent approach to enumerations, to address implementation needs for an array property, and to provide a migration path from today's environment to the future. This change was not made earlier because it required the deprecated qualifier. Due to the widespread use of the existing Status property in management applications, it is strongly recommended that providers or instrumentation provide both the Status and OperationalStatus properties. Further, the first value of OperationalStatus should contain the primary status for the element. When instrumented, Status (because it is single-valued) should also provide the primary status of the element."

By default, the RequestedState of the element is 5 ('No Change'). Refer to the EnabledState property description for explanations of the values in the RequestedState enumeration. It should be noted that there are two new values in RequestedState that build on the statuses of EnabledState. These are 'Reboot' (10) and 'Reset' (11). Reboot refers to doing a 'Shut Down' and then moving to an 'Enabled' state. Reset indicates that the element is first 'Disabled' and then 'Enabled'. The distinction between requesting 'Shut Down' and 'Disabled' should also be noted. Shut Down requests an orderly transition to the Disabled state, and might involve removing power, to completely erase any existing state. The Disabled state requests an immediate disabling of the element, such that it will not execute or accept any commands or processing requests. This property is set as the result of a method invocation (such as Start or StopService on CIM_Service), or can be overridden and defined as WRITEable in a subclass. The method approach is considered superior to a WRITEable property, because it allows an explicit invocation of the operation and the return of a result code. A particular instance of EnabledLogicalElement might not support RequestedStateChange. If this occurs, the value 12 ('Not Applicable') is used."

This definition overcomes the limitation of describing status using a single value, when it is really a multi-valued property (for example, an element might be OK AND Stopped. 2) A MaxLen of 10 is too restrictive and leads to unclear enumerated values. 3) The change to a uint16 data type was discussed when CIM V2.0 was defined. However, existing V1.0 implementations used the string property and did not want to modify their code. Therefore, Status was grandfathered into the Schema.

To ensure uniqueness within the NameSpace, the value of InstanceID should be constructed using the following 'preferred' algorithm: <OrgID>:<LocalID> Where <OrgID> and <LocalID> are separated by a colon (:), and where <OrgID> must include a copyrighted, trademarked, or otherwise unique name that is owned by the business entity that is creating or defining the InstanceID or that is a registered ID assigned to the business entity by a recognized global authority. (This requirement is similar to the <Schema Name>_<Class Name> structure of Schema class names.) In addition, to ensure uniqueness, <OrgID> must not contain a colon (:). When using this algorithm, the first colon to appear in InstanceID must appear between <OrgID> and <LocalID>. <LocalID> is chosen by the business entity and should not be reused to identify different underlying (real-world) elements. If the above 'preferred' algorithm is not used, the defining entity must assure that the resulting InstanceID is not reused across any InstanceIDs produced by this or other providers for the NameSpace of this instance. For DMTF-defined instances, the 'preferred' algorithm must be used with the <OrgID> set to CIM."

For example, the element might not be operating at optimal performance or it might be reporting recoverable errors. 'OK' (5) - The element is fully functional and is operating within normal operational parameters and without error. 'Unknown' (0) - The implementation cannot report on HealthState at this time. DMTF has reserved the unused portion of the continuum for additional HealthStates in the future."

This definition overcomes the limitation of describing status using a single value, when it is really a multi-valued property (for example, an element might be OK AND Stopped. 2) A MaxLen of 10 is too restrictive and leads to unclear enumerated values. 3) The change to a uint16 data type was discussed when CIM V2.0 was defined. However, existing V1.0 implementations used the string property and did not want to modify their code. Therefore, Status was grandfathered into the Schema.

However, a few are not and are described here in more detail. 'Stressed' indicates that the element is functioning, but needs attention. Examples of 'Stressed' states are overload, overheated, and so on. 'Predictive Failure' indicates that an element is functioning nominally but predicting a failure in the near future. 'In Service' describes an element being configured, maintained, cleaned, or otherwise administered. 'No Contact' indicates that the monitoring system has knowledge of this element, but has never been able to establish communications with it. 'Lost Communication' indicates that the ManagedSystem Element is known to exist and has been contacted successfully in the past, but is currently unreachable. 'Stopped' and 'Aborted' are similar, although the former implies a clean and orderly stop, while the latter implies an abrupt stop where the state and configuration of the element might need to be updated. 'Dormant' indicates that the element is inactive or quiesced. 'Supporting Entity in Error' indicates that this element might be 'OK' but that another element, on which it is dependent, is in error. An example is a network service or endpoint that cannot function due to lower-layer networking problems. 'Completed' indicates that the element has completed its operation. This value should be combined with either OK, Error, or Degraded so that a client can tell if the complete operation Completed with OK (passed), Completed with Error (failed), or Completed with Degraded (the operation finished, but it did not complete OK or did not report an error). 'Power Mode' indicates that the element has additional power model information contained in the Associated PowerManagementService association. OperationalStatus replaces the Status property on ManagedSystemElement to provide a consistent approach to enumerations, to address implementation needs for an array property, and to provide a migration path from today's environment to the future. This change was not made earlier because it required the deprecated qualifier. Due to the widespread use of the existing Status property in management applications, it is strongly recommended that providers or instrumentation provide both the Status and OperationalStatus properties. Further, the first value of OperationalStatus should contain the primary status for the element. When instrumented, Status (because it is single-valued) should also provide the primary status of the element."

(This requirement is similar to the <Schema Name>_<Class Name> structure of Schema class names.) In addition, to ensure uniqueness, <OrgID> must not contain a colon (:). When using this algorithm, the first colon to appear in InstanceID must appear between <OrgID> and <LocalID>. <LocalID> is chosen by the business entity and should not be reused to identify different underlying (real-world) elements. If the above 'preferred' algorithm is not used, the defining entity must assure that the resulting InstanceID is not reused across any InstanceIDs produced by this or other providers for the NameSpace of this instance.

However, a few are not and are described here in more detail. 'Stressed' indicates that the element is functioning, but needs attention. Examples of 'Stressed' states are overload, overheated, and so on. 'Predictive Failure' indicates that an element is functioning nominally but predicting a failure in the near future. 'In Service' describes an element being configured, maintained, cleaned, or otherwise administered. 'No Contact' indicates that the monitoring system has knowledge of this element, but has never been able to establish communications with it. 'Lost Communication' indicates that the ManagedSystem Element is known to exist and has been contacted successfully in the past, but is currently unreachable. 'Stopped' and 'Aborted' are similar, although the former implies a clean and orderly stop, while the latter implies an abrupt stop where the state and configuration of the element might need to be updated. 'Dormant' indicates that the element is inactive or quiesced. 'Supporting Entity in Error' indicates that this element might be 'OK' but that another element, on which it is dependent, is in error. An example is a network service or endpoint that cannot function due to lower-layer networking problems. 'Completed' indicates that the element has completed its operation. This value should be combined with either OK, Error, or Degraded so that a client can tell if the complete operation Completed with OK (passed), Completed with Error (failed), or Completed with Degraded (the operation finished, but it did not complete OK or did not report an error). 'Power Mode' indicates that the element has additional power model information contained in the Associated PowerManagementService association. OperationalStatus replaces the Status property on ManagedSystemElement to provide a consistent approach to enumerations, to address implementation needs for an array property, and to provide a migration path from today's environment to the future. This change was not made earlier because it required the deprecated qualifier. Due to the widespread use of the existing Status property in management applications, it is strongly recommended that providers or instrumentation provide both the Status and OperationalStatus properties. Further, the first value of OperationalStatus should contain the primary status for the element. When instrumented, Status (because it is single-valued) should also provide the primary status of the element."

This property is deprecated in lieu of OperationalStatus, which includes the same semantics in its enumeration. This change is made for 3 reasons: 1) Status is more correctly defined as an array. This definition overcomes the limitation of describing status using a single value, when it is really a multi-valued property (for example, an element might be OK AND Stopped. 2) A MaxLen of 10 is too restrictive and leads to unclear enumerated values. 3) The change to a uint16 data type was discussed when CIM V2.0 was defined. However, existing V1.0 implementations used the string property and did not want to modify their code. Therefore, Status was grandfathered into the Schema. Use of the deprecated qualifier allows the maintenance of the existing property, but also permits an improved definition using OperationalStatus."

When using this algorithm, the first colon to appear in InstanceID must appear between <OrgID> and <LocalID>. <LocalID> is chosen by the business entity and should not be reused to identify different underlying (real-world) elements. If the above 'preferred' algorithm is not used, the defining entity must assure that the resulting InstanceID is not reused across any InstanceIDs produced by this or other providers for the NameSpace of this instance.

However, a few are not and are described here in more detail. 'Stressed' indicates that the element is functioning, but needs attention. Examples of 'Stressed' states are overload, overheated, and so on. 'Predictive Failure' indicates that an element is functioning nominally but predicting a failure in the near future. 'In Service' describes an element being configured, maintained, cleaned, or otherwise administered. 'No Contact' indicates that the monitoring system has knowledge of this element, but has never been able to establish communications with it. 'Lost Communication' indicates that the ManagedSystem Element is known to exist and has been contacted successfully in the past, but is currently unreachable. 'Stopped' and 'Aborted' are similar, although the former implies a clean and orderly stop, while the latter implies an abrupt stop where the state and configuration of the element might need to be updated. 'Dormant' indicates that the element is inactive or quiesced. 'Supporting Entity in Error' indicates that this element might be 'OK' but that another element, on which it is dependent, is in error. An example is a network service or endpoint that cannot function due to lower-layer networking problems. 'Completed' indicates that the element has completed its operation. This value should be combined with either OK, Error, or Degraded so that a client can tell if the complete operation Completed with OK (passed), Completed with Error (failed), or Completed with Degraded (the operation finished, but it did not complete OK or did not report an error). 'Power Mode' indicates that the element has additional power model information contained in the Associated PowerManagementService association. OperationalStatus replaces the Status property on ManagedSystemElement to provide a consistent approach to enumerations, to address implementation needs for an array property, and to provide a migration path from today's environment to the future. This change was not made earlier because it required the deprecated qualifier. Due to the widespread use of the existing Status property in management applications, it is strongly recommended that providers or instrumentation provide both the Status and OperationalStatus properties. Further, the first value of OperationalStatus should contain the primary status for the element. When instrumented, Status (because it is single-valued) should also provide the primary status of the element."

This definition overcomes the limitation of describing status using a single value, when it is really a multi-valued property (for example, an element might be OK AND Stopped. 2) A MaxLen of 10 is too restrictive and leads to unclear enumerated values. 3) The change to a uint16 data type was discussed when CIM V2.0 was defined. However, existing V1.0 implementations used the string property and did not want to modify their code. Therefore, Status was grandfathered into the Schema.

However, a few are not and are described here in more detail. 'Stressed' indicates that the element is functioning, but needs attention. Examples of 'Stressed' states are overload, overheated, and so on. 'Predictive Failure' indicates that an element is functioning nominally but predicting a failure in the near future. 'In Service' describes an element being configured, maintained, cleaned, or otherwise administered. 'No Contact' indicates that the monitoring system has knowledge of this element, but has never been able to establish communications with it. 'Lost Communication' indicates that the ManagedSystem Element is known to exist and has been contacted successfully in the past, but is currently unreachable. 'Stopped' and 'Aborted' are similar, although the former implies a clean and orderly stop, while the latter implies an abrupt stop where the state and configuration of the element might need to be updated. 'Dormant' indicates that the element is inactive or quiesced. 'Supporting Entity in Error' indicates that this element might be 'OK' but that another element, on which it is dependent, is in error. An example is a network service or endpoint that cannot function due to lower-layer networking problems. 'Completed' indicates that the element has completed its operation. This value should be combined with either OK, Error, or Degraded so that a client can tell if the complete operation Completed with OK (passed), Completed with Error (failed), or Completed with Degraded (the operation finished, but it did not complete OK or did not report an error). 'Power Mode' indicates that the element has additional power model information contained in the Associated PowerManagementService association. OperationalStatus replaces the Status property on ManagedSystemElement to provide a consistent approach to enumerations, to address implementation needs for an array property, and to provide a migration path from today's environment to the future. This change was not made earlier because it required the deprecated qualifier. Due to the widespread use of the existing Status property in management applications, it is strongly recommended that providers or instrumentation provide both the Status and OperationalStatus properties. Further, the first value of OperationalStatus should contain the primary status for the element. When instrumented, Status (because it is single-valued) should also provide the primary status of the element."

By default, the RequestedState of the element is 5 ('No Change'). Refer to the EnabledState property description for explanations of the values in the RequestedState enumeration. It should be noted that there are two new values in RequestedState that build on the statuses of EnabledState. These are 'Reboot' (10) and 'Reset' (11). Reboot refers to doing a 'Shut Down' and then moving to an 'Enabled' state. Reset indicates that the element is first 'Disabled' and then 'Enabled'. The distinction between requesting 'Shut Down' and 'Disabled' should also be noted. Shut Down requests an orderly transition to the Disabled state, and might involve removing power, to completely erase any existing state. The Disabled state requests an immediate disabling of the element, such that it will not execute or accept any commands or processing requests. This property is set as the result of a method invocation (such as Start or StopService on CIM_Service), or can be overridden and defined as WRITEable in a subclass. The method approach is considered superior to a WRITEable property, because it allows an explicit invocation of the operation and the return of a result code. A particular instance of EnabledLogicalElement might not support RequestedStateChange. If this occurs, the value 12 ('Not Applicable') is used."

This definition overcomes the limitation of describing status using a single value, when it is really a multi-valued property (for example, an element might be OK AND Stopped. 2) A MaxLen of 10 is too restrictive and leads to unclear enumerated values. 3) The change to a uint16 data type was discussed when CIM V2.0 was defined. However, existing V1.0 implementations used the string property and did not want to modify their code. Therefore, Status was grandfathered into the Schema.

    "description": "Indicates the current statuses of the element. Various operational statuses are defined. Many of the enumeration's values are self-explanatory. However, a few are not and are described here in more detail. 'Stressed' indicates that the element is functioning, but needs attention. Examples of 'Stressed' states are overload, overheated, and so on. 'Predictive Failure' indicates that an element is functioning nominally but predicting a failure in the near future. 'In Service' describes an element being configured, maintained, cleaned, or otherwise administered. 'No Contact' indicates that the monitoring system has knowledge of this element, but has never been able to establish communications with it. 'Lost Communication' indicates that the ManagedSystem Element is known to exist and has been contacted successfully in the past, but is currently unreachable. 'Stopped' and 'Aborted' are similar, although the former implies a clean and orderly stop, while the latter implies an abrupt stop where the state and configuration of the element might need to be updated. 'Dormant' indicates that the element is inactive or quiesced. 'Supporting Entity in Error' indicates that this element might be 'OK' but that another element, on which it is dependent, is in error. An example is a network service or endpoint that cannot function due to lower-layer networking problems. 'Completed' indicates that the element has completed its operation. This value should be combined with either OK, Error, or Degraded so that a client can tell if the complete operation Completed with OK (passed), Completed with Error (failed), or Completed with Degraded (the operation finished, but it did not complete OK or did not report an error). 'Power Mode' indicates that the element has additional power model information contained in the Associated PowerManagementService association. OperationalStatus replaces the Status property on ManagedSystemElement to provide a consistent approach to enumerations, to address implementation needs for an array property, and to provide a migration path from today's environment to the future. This change was not made earlier because it required the deprecated qualifier. Due to the widespread use of the existing Status property in management applications, it is strongly recommended that providers or instrumentation provide both the Status and OperationalStatus properties. Further, the first value of OperationalStatus should contain the primary status for the element. When instrumented, Status (because it is single-valued) should also provide the primary status of the element."

This property is provided to compare the last requested and current enabled or disabled states. Note that when EnabledState is set to 5 ('Not Applicable'), then this property has no meaning. By default, the RequestedState of the element is 5 ('No Change'). Refer to the EnabledState property description for explanations of the values in the RequestedState enumeration. It should be noted that there are two new values in RequestedState that build on the statuses of EnabledState. These are 'Reboot' (10) and 'Reset' (11). Reboot refers to doing a 'Shut Down' and then moving to an 'Enabled' state. Reset indicates that the element is first 'Disabled' and then 'Enabled'. The distinction between requesting 'Shut Down' and 'Disabled' should also be noted. Shut Down requests an orderly transition to the Disabled state, and might involve removing power, to completely erase any existing state. The Disabled state requests an immediate disabling of the element, such that it will not execute or accept any commands or processing requests. This property is set as the result of a method invocation (such as Start or StopService on CIM_Service), or can be overridden and defined as WRITEable in a subclass. The method approach is considered superior to a WRITEable property, because it allows an explicit invocation of the operation and the return of a result code. A particular instance of EnabledLogicalElement might not support RequestedStateChange. If this occurs, the value 12 ('Not Applicable') is used."

This definition overcomes the limitation of describing status using a single value, when it is really a multi-valued property (for example, an element might be OK AND Stopped. 2) A MaxLen of 10 is too restrictive and leads to unclear enumerated values. 3) The change to a uint16 data type was discussed when CIM V2.0 was defined. However, existing V1.0 implementations used the string property and did not want to modify their code. Therefore, Status was grandfathered into the Schema.

Disabled (3) indicates that the element will not execute commands and will drop any new requests. Shutting Down (4) indicates that the element is in the process of going to a Disabled state. Not Applicable (5) indicates the element does not support being enabled or disabled. Enabled but Offline (6) indicates that the element might be completing commands, and will drop any new requests. Test (7) indicates that the element is in a test state. Deferred (8) indicates that the element might be completing commands, but will queue any new requests. Quiesce (9) indicates that the element is enabled but in a restricted mode. The behavior of the element is similar to the Enabled state, but it processes only a restricted set of commands. All other requests are queued. Starting (10) indicates that the element is in the process of going to an Enabled state. New requests are queued."

However, a few are not and are described here in more detail. 'Stressed' indicates that the element is functioning, but needs attention. Examples of 'Stressed' states are overload, overheated, and so on. 'Predictive Failure' indicates that an element is functioning nominally but predicting a failure in the near future. 'In Service' describes an element being configured, maintained, cleaned, or otherwise administered. 'No Contact' indicates that the monitoring system has knowledge of this element, but has never been able to establish communications with it. 'Lost Communication' indicates that the ManagedSystem Element is known to exist and has been contacted successfully in the past, but is currently unreachable. 'Stopped' and 'Aborted' are similar, although the former implies a clean and orderly stop, while the latter implies an abrupt stop where the state and configuration of the element might need to be updated. 'Dormant' indicates that the element is inactive or quiesced. 'Supporting Entity in Error' indicates that this element might be 'OK' but that another element, on which it is dependent, is in error. An example is a network service or endpoint that cannot function due to lower-layer networking problems. 'Completed' indicates that the element has completed its operation. This value should be combined with either OK, Error, or Degraded so that a client can tell if the complete operation Completed with OK (passed), Completed with Error (failed), or Completed with Degraded (the operation finished, but it did not complete OK or did not report an error). 'Power Mode' indicates that the element has additional power model information contained in the Associated PowerManagementService association. OperationalStatus replaces the Status property on ManagedSystemElement to provide a consistent approach to enumerations, to address implementation needs for an array property, and to provide a migration path from today's environment to the future. This change was not made earlier because it required the deprecated qualifier. Due to the widespread use of the existing Status property in management applications, it is strongly recommended that providers or instrumentation provide both the Status and OperationalStatus properties. Further, the first value of OperationalStatus should contain the primary status for the element. When instrumented, Status (because it is single-valued) should also provide the primary status of the element."

This property is provided to compare the last requested and current enabled or disabled states. Note that when EnabledState is set to 5 ('Not Applicable'), then this property has no meaning. By default, the RequestedState of the element is 5 ('No Change'). Refer to the EnabledState property description for explanations of the values in the RequestedState enumeration. It should be noted that there are two new values in RequestedState that build on the statuses of EnabledState. These are 'Reboot' (10) and 'Reset' (11). Reboot refers to doing a 'Shut Down' and then moving to an 'Enabled' state. Reset indicates that the element is first 'Disabled' and then 'Enabled'. The distinction between requesting 'Shut Down' and 'Disabled' should also be noted. Shut Down requests an orderly transition to the Disabled state, and might involve removing power, to completely erase any existing state. The Disabled state requests an immediate disabling of the element, such that it will not execute or accept any commands or processing requests. This property is set as the result of a method invocation (such as Start or StopService on CIM_Service), or can be overridden and defined as WRITEable in a subclass. The method approach is considered superior to a WRITEable property, because it allows an explicit invocation of the operation and the return of a result code. A particular instance of EnabledLogicalElement might not support RequestedStateChange. If this occurs, the value 12 ('Not Applicable') is used."

This property is deprecated in lieu of OperationalStatus, which includes the same semantics in its enumeration. This change is made for 3 reasons: 1) Status is more correctly defined as an array. This definition overcomes the limitation of describing status using a single value, when it is really a multi-valued property (for example, an element might be OK AND Stopped. 2) A MaxLen of 10 is too restrictive and leads to unclear enumerated values. 3) The change to a uint16 data type was discussed when CIM V2.0 was defined. However, existing V1.0 implementations used the string property and did not want to modify their code. Therefore, Status was grandfathered into the Schema. Use of the deprecated qualifier allows the maintenance of the existing property, but also permits an improved definition using OperationalStatus."

However, a few are not and are described here in more detail. 'Stressed' indicates that the element is functioning, but needs attention. Examples of 'Stressed' states are overload, overheated, and so on. 'Predictive Failure' indicates that an element is functioning nominally but predicting a failure in the near future. 'In Service' describes an element being configured, maintained, cleaned, or otherwise administered. 'No Contact' indicates that the monitoring system has knowledge of this element, but has never been able to establish communications with it. 'Lost Communication' indicates that the ManagedSystem Element is known to exist and has been contacted successfully in the past, but is currently unreachable. 'Stopped' and 'Aborted' are similar, although the former implies a clean and orderly stop, while the latter implies an abrupt stop where the state and configuration of the element might need to be updated. 'Dormant' indicates that the element is inactive or quiesced. 'Supporting Entity in Error' indicates that this element might be 'OK' but that another element, on which it is dependent, is in error. An example is a network service or endpoint that cannot function due to lower-layer networking problems. 'Completed' indicates that the element has completed its operation. This value should be combined with either OK, Error, or Degraded so that a client can tell if the complete operation Completed with OK (passed), Completed with Error (failed), or Completed with Degraded (the operation finished, but it did not complete OK or did not report an error). 'Power Mode' indicates that the element has additional power model information contained in the Associated PowerManagementService association. OperationalStatus replaces the Status property on ManagedSystemElement to provide a consistent approach to enumerations, to address implementation needs for an array property, and to provide a migration path from today's environment to the future. This change was not made earlier because it required the deprecated qualifier. Due to the widespread use of the existing Status property in management applications, it is strongly recommended that providers or instrumentation provide both the Status and OperationalStatus properties. Further, the first value of OperationalStatus should contain the primary status for the element. When instrumented, Status (because it is single-valued) should also provide the primary status of the element."

This property is provided to compare the last requested and current enabled or disabled states. Note that when EnabledState is set to 5 ('Not Applicable'), then this property has no meaning. By default, the RequestedState of the element is 5 ('No Change'). Refer to the EnabledState property description for explanations of the values in the RequestedState enumeration. It should be noted that there are two new values in RequestedState that build on the statuses of EnabledState. These are 'Reboot' (10) and 'Reset' (11). Reboot refers to doing a 'Shut Down' and then moving to an 'Enabled' state. Reset indicates that the element is first 'Disabled' and then 'Enabled'. The distinction between requesting 'Shut Down' and 'Disabled' should also be noted. Shut Down requests an orderly transition to the Disabled state, and might involve removing power, to completely erase any existing state. The Disabled state requests an immediate disabling of the element, such that it will not execute or accept any commands or processing requests. This property is set as the result of a method invocation (such as Start or StopService on CIM_Service), or can be overridden and defined as WRITEable in a subclass. The method approach is considered superior to a WRITEable property, because it allows an explicit invocation of the operation and the return of a result code. A particular instance of EnabledLogicalElement might not support RequestedStateChange. If this occurs, the value 12 ('Not Applicable') is used."

This property is deprecated in lieu of OperationalStatus, which includes the same semantics in its enumeration. This change is made for 3 reasons: 1) Status is more correctly defined as an array. This definition overcomes the limitation of describing status using a single value, when it is really a multi-valued property (for example, an element might be OK AND Stopped. 2) A MaxLen of 10 is too restrictive and leads to unclear enumerated values. 3) The change to a uint16 data type was discussed when CIM V2.0 was defined. However, existing V1.0 implementations used the string property and did not want to modify their code. Therefore, Status was grandfathered into the Schema. Use of the deprecated qualifier allows the maintenance of the existing property, but also permits an improved definition using OperationalStatus."

For example, shutting down (value=4) and starting (value=10) are transient states between enabled and disabled. The following text briefly summarizes the various enabled and disabled states: Enabled (2) indicates that the element is or could be executing commands, will process any queued commands, and queues new requests. Disabled (3) indicates that the element will not execute commands and will drop any new requests. Shutting Down (4) indicates that the element is in the process of going to a Disabled state. Not Applicable (5) indicates the element does not support being enabled or disabled. Enabled but Offline (6) indicates that the element might be completing commands, and will drop any new requests. Test (7) indicates that the element is in a test state. Deferred (8) indicates that the element might be completing commands, but will queue any new requests. Quiesce (9) indicates that the element is enabled but in a restricted mode. The behavior of the element is similar to the Enabled state, but it processes only a restricted set of commands. All other requests are queued. Starting (10) indicates that the element is in the process of going to an Enabled state. New requests are queued."

However, a few are not and are described here in more detail. 'Stressed' indicates that the element is functioning, but needs attention. Examples of 'Stressed' states are overload, overheated, and so on. 'Predictive Failure' indicates that an element is functioning nominally but predicting a failure in the near future. 'In Service' describes an element being configured, maintained, cleaned, or otherwise administered. 'No Contact' indicates that the monitoring system has knowledge of this element, but has never been able to establish communications with it. 'Lost Communication' indicates that the ManagedSystem Element is known to exist and has been contacted successfully in the past, but is currently unreachable. 'Stopped' and 'Aborted' are similar, although the former implies a clean and orderly stop, while the latter implies an abrupt stop where the state and configuration of the element might need to be updated. 'Dormant' indicates that the element is inactive or quiesced. 'Supporting Entity in Error' indicates that this element might be 'OK' but that another element, on which it is dependent, is in error. An example is a network service or endpoint that cannot function due to lower-layer networking problems. 'Completed' indicates that the element has completed its operation. This value should be combined with either OK, Error, or Degraded so that a client can tell if the complete operation Completed with OK (passed), Completed with Error (failed), or Completed with Degraded (the operation finished, but it did not complete OK or did not report an error). 'Power Mode' indicates that the element has additional power model information contained in the Associated PowerManagementService association. OperationalStatus replaces the Status property on ManagedSystemElement to provide a consistent approach to enumerations, to address implementation needs for an array property, and to provide a migration path from today's environment to the future. This change was not made earlier because it required the deprecated qualifier. Due to the widespread use of the existing Status property in management applications, it is strongly recommended that providers or instrumentation provide both the Status and OperationalStatus properties. Further, the first value of OperationalStatus should contain the primary status for the element. When instrumented, Status (because it is single-valued) should also provide the primary status of the element."

    "description": "RequestedState is an integer enumeration that indicates the last requested or desired state for the element. The actual state of the element is represented by EnabledState. This property is provided to compare the last requested and current enabled or disabled states. Note that when EnabledState is set to 5 ('Not Applicable'), then this property has no meaning. By default, the RequestedState of the element is 5 ('No Change'). Refer to the EnabledState property description for explanations of the values in the RequestedState enumeration. It should be noted that there are two new values in RequestedState that build on the statuses of EnabledState. These are 'Reboot' (10) and 'Reset' (11). Reboot refers to doing a 'Shut Down' and then moving to an 'Enabled' state. Reset indicates that the element is first 'Disabled' and then 'Enabled'. The distinction between requesting 'Shut Down' and 'Disabled' should also be noted. Shut Down requests an orderly transition to the Disabled state, and might involve removing power, to completely erase any existing state. The Disabled state requests an immediate disabling of the element, such that it will not execute or accept any commands or processing requests. This property is set as the result of a method invocation (such as Start or StopService on CIM_Service), or can be overridden and defined as WRITEable in a subclass. The method approach is considered superior to a WRITEable property, because it allows an explicit invocation of the operation and the return of a result code. A particular instance of EnabledLogicalElement might not support RequestedStateChange. If this occurs, the value 12 ('Not Applicable') is used."

This property is deprecated in lieu of OperationalStatus, which includes the same semantics in its enumeration. This change is made for 3 reasons: 1) Status is more correctly defined as an array. This definition overcomes the limitation of describing status using a single value, when it is really a multi-valued property (for example, an element might be OK AND Stopped. 2) A MaxLen of 10 is too restrictive and leads to unclear enumerated values. 3) The change to a uint16 data type was discussed when CIM V2.0 was defined. However, existing V1.0 implementations used the string property and did not want to modify their code. Therefore, Status was grandfathered into the Schema. Use of the deprecated qualifier allows the maintenance of the existing property, but also permits an improved definition using OperationalStatus."

    "description": "Indicates the current statuses of the element. Various operational statuses are defined. Many of the enumeration's values are self-explanatory. However, a few are not and are described here in more detail. 'Stressed' indicates that the element is functioning, but needs attention. Examples of 'Stressed' states are overload, overheated, and so on. 'Predictive Failure' indicates that an element is functioning nominally but predicting a failure in the near future. 'In Service' describes an element being configured, maintained, cleaned, or otherwise administered. 'No Contact' indicates that the monitoring system has knowledge of this element, but has never been able to establish communications with it. 'Lost Communication' indicates that the ManagedSystem Element is known to exist and has been contacted successfully in the past, but is currently unreachable. 'Stopped' and 'Aborted' are similar, although the former implies a clean and orderly stop, while the latter implies an abrupt stop where the state and configuration of the element might need to be updated. 'Dormant' indicates that the element is inactive or quiesced. 'Supporting Entity in Error' indicates that this element might be 'OK' but that another element, on which it is dependent, is in error. An example is a network service or endpoint that cannot function due to lower-layer networking problems. 'Completed' indicates that the element has completed its operation. This value should be combined with either OK, Error, or Degraded so that a client can tell if the complete operation Completed with OK (passed), Completed with Error (failed), or Completed with Degraded (the operation finished, but it did not complete OK or did not report an error). 'Power Mode' indicates that the element has additional power model information contained in the Associated PowerManagementService association. OperationalStatus replaces the Status property on ManagedSystemElement to provide a consistent approach to enumerations, to address implementation needs for an array property, and to provide a migration path from today's environment to the future. This change was not made earlier because it required the deprecated qualifier. Due to the widespread use of the existing Status property in management applications, it is strongly recommended that providers or instrumentation provide both the Status and OperationalStatus properties. Further, the first value of OperationalStatus should contain the primary status for the element. When instrumented, Status (because it is single-valued) should also provide the primary status of the element."

By default, the RequestedState of the element is 5 ('No Change'). Refer to the EnabledState property description for explanations of the values in the RequestedState enumeration. It should be noted that there are two new values in RequestedState that build on the statuses of EnabledState. These are 'Reboot' (10) and 'Reset' (11). Reboot refers to doing a 'Shut Down' and then moving to an 'Enabled' state. Reset indicates that the element is first 'Disabled' and then 'Enabled'. The distinction between requesting 'Shut Down' and 'Disabled' should also be noted. Shut Down requests an orderly transition to the Disabled state, and might involve removing power, to completely erase any existing state. The Disabled state requests an immediate disabling of the element, such that it will not execute or accept any commands or processing requests. This property is set as the result of a method invocation (such as Start or StopService on CIM_Service), or can be overridden and defined as WRITEable in a subclass. The method approach is considered superior to a WRITEable property, because it allows an explicit invocation of the operation and the return of a result code. A particular instance of EnabledLogicalElement might not support RequestedStateChange. If this occurs, the value 12 ('Not Applicable') is used."

This definition overcomes the limitation of describing status using a single value, when it is really a multi-valued property (for example, an element might be OK AND Stopped. 2) A MaxLen of 10 is too restrictive and leads to unclear enumerated values. 3) The change to a uint16 data type was discussed when CIM V2.0 was defined. However, existing V1.0 implementations used the string property and did not want to modify their code. Therefore, Status was grandfathered into the Schema.

'Lost Communication' indicates that the ManagedSystem Element is known to exist and has been contacted successfully in the past, but is currently unreachable. 'Stopped' and 'Aborted' are similar, although the former implies a clean and orderly stop, while the latter implies an abrupt stop where the state and configuration of the element might need to be updated. 'Dormant' indicates that the element is inactive or quiesced. 'Supporting Entity in Error' indicates that this element might be 'OK' but that another element, on which it is dependent, is in error. An example is a network service or endpoint that cannot function due to lower-layer networking problems. 'Completed' indicates that the element has completed its operation. This value should be combined with either OK, Error, or Degraded so that a client can tell if the complete operation Completed with OK (passed), Completed with Error (failed), or Completed with Degraded (the operation finished, but it did not complete OK or did not report an error). 'Power Mode' indicates that the element has additional power model information contained in the Associated PowerManagementService association. OperationalStatus replaces the Status property on ManagedSystemElement to provide a consistent approach to enumerations, to address implementation needs for an array property, and to provide a migration path from today's environment to the future. This change was not made earlier because it required the deprecated qualifier. Due to the widespread use of the existing Status property in management applications, it is strongly recommended that providers or instrumentation provide both the Status and OperationalStatus properties. Further, the first value of OperationalStatus should contain the primary status for the element. When instrumented, Status (because it is single-valued) should also provide the primary status of the element."

By default, the RequestedState of the element is 5 ('No Change'). Refer to the EnabledState property description for explanations of the values in the RequestedState enumeration. It should be noted that there are two new values in RequestedState that build on the statuses of EnabledState. These are 'Reboot' (10) and 'Reset' (11). Reboot refers to doing a 'Shut Down' and then moving to an 'Enabled' state. Reset indicates that the element is first 'Disabled' and then 'Enabled'. The distinction between requesting 'Shut Down' and 'Disabled' should also be noted. Shut Down requests an orderly transition to the Disabled state, and might involve removing power, to completely erase any existing state. The Disabled state requests an immediate disabling of the element, such that it will not execute or accept any commands or processing requests. This property is set as the result of a method invocation (such as Start or StopService on CIM_Service), or can be overridden and defined as WRITEable in a subclass. The method approach is considered superior to a WRITEable property, because it allows an explicit invocation of the operation and the return of a result code. A particular instance of EnabledLogicalElement might not support RequestedStateChange. If this occurs, the value 12 ('Not Applicable') is used."

This definition overcomes the limitation of describing status using a single value, when it is really a multi-valued property (for example, an element might be OK AND Stopped. 2) A MaxLen of 10 is too restrictive and leads to unclear enumerated values. 3) The change to a uint16 data type was discussed when CIM V2.0 was defined. However, existing V1.0 implementations used the string property and did not want to modify their code. Therefore, Status was grandfathered into the Schema. Use of the deprecated qualifier allows the maintenance of the existing property, but also permits an improved definition using OperationalStatus."

Test (7) indicates that the element is in a test state. Deferred (8) indicates that the element might be completing commands, but will queue any new requests. Quiesce (9) indicates that the element is enabled but in a restricted mode. The behavior of the element is similar to the Enabled state, but it processes only a restricted set of commands.

    "description": "Indicates the current statuses of the element. Various operational statuses are defined. Many of the enumeration's values are self-explanatory. However, a few are not and are described here in more detail. 'Stressed' indicates that the element is functioning, but needs attention. Examples of 'Stressed' states are overload, overheated, and so on. 'Predictive Failure' indicates that an element is functioning nominally but predicting a failure in the near future. 'In Service' describes an element being configured, maintained, cleaned, or otherwise administered. 'No Contact' indicates that the monitoring system has knowledge of this element, but has never been able to establish communications with it. 'Lost Communication' indicates that the ManagedSystem Element is known to exist and has been contacted successfully in the past, but is currently unreachable. 'Stopped' and 'Aborted' are similar, although the former implies a clean and orderly stop, while the latter implies an abrupt stop where the state and configuration of the element might need to be updated. 'Dormant' indicates that the element is inactive or quiesced. 'Supporting Entity in Error' indicates that this element might be 'OK' but that another element, on which it is dependent, is in error. An example is a network service or endpoint that cannot function due to lower-layer networking problems. 'Completed' indicates that the element has completed its operation. This value should be combined with either OK, Error, or Degraded so that a client can tell if the complete operation Completed with OK (passed), Completed with Error (failed), or Completed with Degraded (the operation finished, but it did not complete OK or did not report an error). 'Power Mode' indicates that the element has additional power model information contained in the Associated PowerManagementService association. OperationalStatus replaces the Status property on ManagedSystemElement to provide a consistent approach to enumerations, to address implementation needs for an array property, and to provide a migration path from today's environment to the future. This change was not made earlier because it required the deprecated qualifier. Due to the widespread use of the existing Status property in management applications, it is strongly recommended that providers or instrumentation provide both the Status and OperationalStatus properties. Further, the first value of OperationalStatus should contain the primary status for the element. When instrumented, Status (because it is single-valued) should also provide the primary status of the element."

This property is provided to compare the last requested and current enabled or disabled states. Note that when EnabledState is set to 5 ('Not Applicable'), then this property has no meaning. By default, the RequestedState of the element is 5 ('No Change'). Refer to the EnabledState property description for explanations of the values in the RequestedState enumeration. It should be noted that there are two new values in RequestedState that build on the statuses of EnabledState. These are 'Reboot' (10) and 'Reset' (11). Reboot refers to doing a 'Shut Down' and then moving to an 'Enabled' state. Reset indicates that the element is first 'Disabled' and then 'Enabled'. The distinction between requesting 'Shut Down' and 'Disabled' should also be noted. Shut Down requests an orderly transition to the Disabled state, and might involve removing power, to completely erase any existing state. The Disabled state requests an immediate disabling of the element, such that it will not execute or accept any commands or processing requests. This property is set as the result of a method invocation (such as Start or StopService on CIM_Service), or can be overridden and defined as WRITEable in a subclass. The method approach is considered superior to a WRITEable property, because it allows an explicit invocation of the operation and the return of a result code. A particular instance of EnabledLogicalElement might not support RequestedStateChange. If this occurs, the value 12 ('Not Applicable') is used."

    "description": "Indicates the current statuses of the element. Various operational statuses are defined. Many of the enumeration's values are self-explanatory. However, a few are not and are described here in more detail. 'Stressed' indicates that the element is functioning, but needs attention. Examples of 'Stressed' states are overload, overheated, and so on. 'Predictive Failure' indicates that an element is functioning nominally but predicting a failure in the near future. 'In Service' describes an element being configured, maintained, cleaned, or otherwise administered. 'No Contact' indicates that the monitoring system has knowledge of this element, but has never been able to establish communications with it. 'Lost Communication' indicates that the ManagedSystem Element is known to exist and has been contacted successfully in the past, but is currently unreachable. 'Stopped' and 'Aborted' are similar, although the former implies a clean and orderly stop, while the latter implies an abrupt stop where the state and configuration of the element might need to be updated. 'Dormant' indicates that the element is inactive or quiesced. 'Supporting Entity in Error' indicates that this element might be 'OK' but that another element, on which it is dependent, is in error. An example is a network service or endpoint that cannot function due to lower-layer networking problems. 'Completed' indicates that the element has completed its operation. This value should be combined with either OK, Error, or Degraded so that a client can tell if the complete operation Completed with OK (passed), Completed with Error (failed), or Completed with Degraded (the operation finished, but it did not complete OK or did not report an error). 'Power Mode' indicates that the element has additional power model information contained in the Associated PowerManagementService association. OperationalStatus replaces the Status property on ManagedSystemElement to provide a consistent approach to enumerations, to address implementation needs for an array property, and to provide a migration path from today's environment to the future. This change was not made earlier because it required the deprecated qualifier. Due to the widespread use of the existing Status property in management applications, it is strongly recommended that providers or instrumentation provide both the Status and OperationalStatus properties. Further, the first value of OperationalStatus should contain the primary status for the element. When instrumented, Status (because it is single-valued) should also provide the primary status of the element."

By default, the RequestedState of the element is 5 ('No Change'). Refer to the EnabledState property description for explanations of the values in the RequestedState enumeration. It should be noted that there are two new values in RequestedState that build on the statuses of EnabledState. These are 'Reboot' (10) and 'Reset' (11). Reboot refers to doing a 'Shut Down' and then moving to an 'Enabled' state. Reset indicates that the element is first 'Disabled' and then 'Enabled'. The distinction between requesting 'Shut Down' and 'Disabled' should also be noted. Shut Down requests an orderly transition to the Disabled state, and might involve removing power, to completely erase any existing state. The Disabled state requests an immediate disabling of the element, such that it will not execute or accept any commands or processing requests. This property is set as the result of a method invocation (such as Start or StopService on CIM_Service), or can be overridden and defined as WRITEable in a subclass. The method approach is considered superior to a WRITEable property, because it allows an explicit invocation of the operation and the return of a result code.

Disabled (3) indicates that the element will not execute commands and will drop any new requests. Shutting Down (4) indicates that the element is in the process of going to a Disabled state. Not Applicable (5) indicates the element does not support being enabled or disabled. Enabled but Offline (6) indicates that the element might be completing commands, and will drop any new requests. Test (7) indicates that the element is in a test state. Deferred (8) indicates that the element might be completing commands, but will queue any new requests. Quiesce (9) indicates that the element is enabled but in a restricted mode. The behavior of the element is similar to the Enabled state, but it processes only a restricted set of commands. All other requests are queued. Starting (10) indicates that the element is in the process of going to an Enabled state. New requests are queued."

However, a few are not and are described here in more detail. 'Stressed' indicates that the element is functioning, but needs attention. Examples of 'Stressed' states are overload, overheated, and so on. 'Predictive Failure' indicates that an element is functioning nominally but predicting a failure in the near future. 'In Service' describes an element being configured, maintained, cleaned, or otherwise administered. 'No Contact' indicates that the monitoring system has knowledge of this element, but has never been able to establish communications with it. 'Lost Communication' indicates that the ManagedSystem Element is known to exist and has been contacted successfully in the past, but is currently unreachable. 'Stopped' and 'Aborted' are similar, although the former implies a clean and orderly stop, while the latter implies an abrupt stop where the state and configuration of the element might need to be updated. 'Dormant' indicates that the element is inactive or quiesced. 'Supporting Entity in Error' indicates that this element might be 'OK' but that another element, on which it is dependent, is in error. An example is a network service or endpoint that cannot function due to lower-layer networking problems. 'Completed' indicates that the element has completed its operation. This value should be combined with either OK, Error, or Degraded so that a client can tell if the complete operation Completed with OK (passed), Completed with Error (failed), or Completed with Degraded (the operation finished, but it did not complete OK or did not report an error). 'Power Mode' indicates that the element has additional power model information contained in the Associated PowerManagementService association. OperationalStatus replaces the Status property on ManagedSystemElement to provide a consistent approach to enumerations, to address implementation needs for an array property, and to provide a migration path from today's environment to the future. This change was not made earlier because it required the deprecated qualifier. Due to the widespread use of the existing Status property in management applications, it is strongly recommended that providers or instrumentation provide both the Status and OperationalStatus properties. Further, the first value of OperationalStatus should contain the primary status for the element. When instrumented, Status (because it is single-valued) should also provide the primary status of the element."

By default, the RequestedState of the element is 5 ('No Change'). Refer to the EnabledState property description for explanations of the values in the RequestedState enumeration. It should be noted that there are two new values in RequestedState that build on the statuses of EnabledState. These are 'Reboot' (10) and 'Reset' (11). Reboot refers to doing a 'Shut Down' and then moving to an 'Enabled' state. Reset indicates that the element is first 'Disabled' and then 'Enabled'. The distinction between requesting 'Shut Down' and 'Disabled' should also be noted. Shut Down requests an orderly transition to the Disabled state, and might involve removing power, to completely erase any existing state. The Disabled state requests an immediate disabling of the element, such that it will not execute or accept any commands or processing requests. This property is set as the result of a method invocation (such as Start or StopService on CIM_Service), or can be overridden and defined as WRITEable in a subclass. The method approach is considered superior to a WRITEable property, because it allows an explicit invocation of the operation and the return of a result code. A particular instance of EnabledLogicalElement might not support RequestedStateChange. If this occurs, the value 12 ('Not Applicable') is used."

This definition overcomes the limitation of describing status using a single value, when it is really a multi-valued property (for example, an element might be OK AND Stopped. 2) A MaxLen of 10 is too restrictive and leads to unclear enumerated values. 3) The change to a uint16 data type was discussed when CIM V2.0 was defined. However, existing V1.0 implementations used the string property and did not want to modify their code. Therefore, Status was grandfathered into the Schema.

The Device might or might not be functionally active, depending on whether its Availability (or AdditionalAvailability) indicates that it is ('Running/Full Power')(value=3) or ('Off line') (value=8). In an enabled but offline mode, a Device might be performing out-of-band requests, such as running Diagnostics. If StatusInfo is ('Disabled') (value=4), a Device can only be 'enabled' or powered off. In a personal computer environment, ('Disabled') means that the driver of the device is not available in the stack. In other environments, a Device can be disabled by removing its configuration file. A disabled device is physically present in a System and consuming resources, but it cannot be communicated with until a driver is loaded, a configuration file is loaded, or some other 'enabling' activity has occurred."

    "description": "Indicates the current statuses of the element. Various operational statuses are defined. Many of the enumeration's values are self-explanatory. However, a few are not and are described here in more detail. 'Stressed' indicates that the element is functioning, but needs attention. Examples of 'Stressed' states are overload, overheated, and so on. 'Predictive Failure' indicates that an element is functioning nominally but predicting a failure in the near future. 'In Service' describes an element being configured, maintained, cleaned, or otherwise administered. 'No Contact' indicates that the monitoring system has knowledge of this element, but has never been able to establish communications with it. 'Lost Communication' indicates that the ManagedSystem Element is known to exist and has been contacted successfully in the past, but is currently unreachable. 'Stopped' and 'Aborted' are similar, although the former implies a clean and orderly stop, while the latter implies an abrupt stop where the state and configuration of the element might need to be updated. 'Dormant' indicates that the element is inactive or quiesced. 'Supporting Entity in Error' indicates that this element might be 'OK' but that another element, on which it is dependent, is in error. An example is a network service or endpoint that cannot function due to lower-layer networking problems. 'Completed' indicates that the element has completed its operation. This value should be combined with either OK, Error, or Degraded so that a client can tell if the complete operation Completed with OK (passed), Completed with Error (failed), or Completed with Degraded (the operation finished, but it did not complete OK or did not report an error). 'Power Mode' indicates that the element has additional power model information contained in the Associated PowerManagementService association. OperationalStatus replaces the Status property on ManagedSystemElement to provide a consistent approach to enumerations, to address implementation needs for an array property, and to provide a migration path from today's environment to the future. This change was not made earlier because it required the deprecated qualifier. Due to the widespread use of the existing Status property in management applications, it is strongly recommended that providers or instrumentation provide both the Status and OperationalStatus properties. Further, the first value of OperationalStatus should contain the primary status for the element. When instrumented, Status (because it is single-valued) should also provide the primary status of the element."

This definition overcomes the limitation of describing status using a single value, when it is really a multi-valued property (for example, an element might be OK AND Stopped. 2) A MaxLen of 10 is too restrictive and leads to unclear enumerated values. 3) The change to a uint16 data type was discussed when CIM V2.0 was defined. However, existing V1.0 implementations used the string property and did not want to modify their code. Therefore, Status was grandfathered into the Schema.

    "description": "Indicates the current statuses of the element. Various operational statuses are defined. Many of the enumeration's values are self-explanatory. However, a few are not and are described here in more detail. 'Stressed' indicates that the element is functioning, but needs attention. Examples of 'Stressed' states are overload, overheated, and so on. 'Predictive Failure' indicates that an element is functioning nominally but predicting a failure in the near future. 'In Service' describes an element being configured, maintained, cleaned, or otherwise administered. 'No Contact' indicates that the monitoring system has knowledge of this element, but has never been able to establish communications with it. 'Lost Communication' indicates that the ManagedSystem Element is known to exist and has been contacted successfully in the past, but is currently unreachable. 'Stopped' and 'Aborted' are similar, although the former implies a clean and orderly stop, while the latter implies an abrupt stop where the state and configuration of the element might need to be updated. 'Dormant' indicates that the element is inactive or quiesced. 'Supporting Entity in Error' indicates that this element might be 'OK' but that another element, on which it is dependent, is in error. An example is a network service or endpoint that cannot function due to lower-layer networking problems. 'Completed' indicates that the element has completed its operation. This value should be combined with either OK, Error, or Degraded so that a client can tell if the complete operation Completed with OK (passed), Completed with Error (failed), or Completed with Degraded (the operation finished, but it did not complete OK or did not report an error). 'Power Mode' indicates that the element has additional power model information contained in the Associated PowerManagementService association. OperationalStatus replaces the Status property on ManagedSystemElement to provide a consistent approach to enumerations, to address implementation needs for an array property, and to provide a migration path from today's environment to the future. This change was not made earlier because it required the deprecated qualifier. Due to the widespread use of the existing Status property in management applications, it is strongly recommended that providers or instrumentation provide both the Status and OperationalStatus properties. Further, the first value of OperationalStatus should contain the primary status for the element. When instrumented, Status (because it is single-valued) should also provide the primary status of the element."

By default, the RequestedState of the element is 5 ('No Change'). Refer to the EnabledState property description for explanations of the values in the RequestedState enumeration. It should be noted that there are two new values in RequestedState that build on the statuses of EnabledState. These are 'Reboot' (10) and 'Reset' (11). Reboot refers to doing a 'Shut Down' and then moving to an 'Enabled' state. Reset indicates that the element is first 'Disabled' and then 'Enabled'. The distinction between requesting 'Shut Down' and 'Disabled' should also be noted. Shut Down requests an orderly transition to the Disabled state, and might involve removing power, to completely erase any existing state. The Disabled state requests an immediate disabling of the element, such that it will not execute or accept any commands or processing requests. This property is set as the result of a method invocation (such as Start or StopService on CIM_Service), or can be overridden and defined as WRITEable in a subclass. The method approach is considered superior to a WRITEable property, because it allows an explicit invocation of the operation and the return of a result code. A particular instance of EnabledLogicalElement might not support RequestedStateChange. If this occurs, the value 12 ('Not Applicable') is used."

This definition overcomes the limitation of describing status using a single value, when it is really a multi-valued property (for example, an element might be OK AND Stopped. 2) A MaxLen of 10 is too restrictive and leads to unclear enumerated values. 3) The change to a uint16 data type was discussed when CIM V2.0 was defined. However, existing V1.0 implementations used the string property and did not want to modify their code. Therefore, Status was grandfathered into the Schema.

    "description": "Indicates the current statuses of the element. Various operational statuses are defined. Many of the enumeration's values are self-explanatory. However, a few are not and are described here in more detail. 'Stressed' indicates that the element is functioning, but needs attention. Examples of 'Stressed' states are overload, overheated, and so on. 'Predictive Failure' indicates that an element is functioning nominally but predicting a failure in the near future. 'In Service' describes an element being configured, maintained, cleaned, or otherwise administered. 'No Contact' indicates that the monitoring system has knowledge of this element, but has never been able to establish communications with it. 'Lost Communication' indicates that the ManagedSystem Element is known to exist and has been contacted successfully in the past, but is currently unreachable. 'Stopped' and 'Aborted' are similar, although the former implies a clean and orderly stop, while the latter implies an abrupt stop where the state and configuration of the element might need to be updated. 'Dormant' indicates that the element is inactive or quiesced. 'Supporting Entity in Error' indicates that this element might be 'OK' but that another element, on which it is dependent, is in error. An example is a network service or endpoint that cannot function due to lower-layer networking problems. 'Completed' indicates that the element has completed its operation. This value should be combined with either OK, Error, or Degraded so that a client can tell if the complete operation Completed with OK (passed), Completed with Error (failed), or Completed with Degraded (the operation finished, but it did not complete OK or did not report an error). 'Power Mode' indicates that the element has additional power model information contained in the Associated PowerManagementService association. OperationalStatus replaces the Status property on ManagedSystemElement to provide a consistent approach to enumerations, to address implementation needs for an array property, and to provide a migration path from today's environment to the future. This change was not made earlier because it required the deprecated qualifier. Due to the widespread use of the existing Status property in management applications, it is strongly recommended that providers or instrumentation provide both the Status and OperationalStatus properties. Further, the first value of OperationalStatus should contain the primary status for the element. When instrumented, Status (because it is single-valued) should also provide the primary status of the element."

By default, the RequestedState of the element is 5 ('No Change'). Refer to the EnabledState property description for explanations of the values in the RequestedState enumeration. It should be noted that there are two new values in RequestedState that build on the statuses of EnabledState. These are 'Reboot' (10) and 'Reset' (11). Reboot refers to doing a 'Shut Down' and then moving to an 'Enabled' state. Reset indicates that the element is first 'Disabled' and then 'Enabled'. The distinction between requesting 'Shut Down' and 'Disabled' should also be noted. Shut Down requests an orderly transition to the Disabled state, and might involve removing power, to completely erase any existing state. The Disabled state requests an immediate disabling of the element, such that it will not execute or accept any commands or processing requests. This property is set as the result of a method invocation (such as Start or StopService on CIM_Service), or can be overridden and defined as WRITEable in a subclass. The method approach is considered superior to a WRITEable property, because it allows an explicit invocation of the operation and the return of a result code. A particular instance of EnabledLogicalElement might not support RequestedStateChange. If this occurs, the value 12 ('Not Applicable') is used."

This definition overcomes the limitation of describing status using a single value, when it is really a multi-valued property (for example, an element might be OK AND Stopped. 2) A MaxLen of 10 is too restrictive and leads to unclear enumerated values. 3) The change to a uint16 data type was discussed when CIM V2.0 was defined. However, existing V1.0 implementations used the string property and did not want to modify their code. Therefore, Status was grandfathered into the Schema. Use of the deprecated qualifier allows the maintenance of the existing property, but also permits an improved definition using OperationalStatus."

    "description": "Indicates the current statuses of the element. Various operational statuses are defined. Many of the enumeration's values are self-explanatory. However, a few are not and are described here in more detail. 'Stressed' indicates that the element is functioning, but needs attention. Examples of 'Stressed' states are overload, overheated, and so on. 'Predictive Failure' indicates that an element is functioning nominally but predicting a failure in the near future. 'In Service' describes an element being configured, maintained, cleaned, or otherwise administered. 'No Contact' indicates that the monitoring system has knowledge of this element, but has never been able to establish communications with it. 'Lost Communication' indicates that the ManagedSystem Element is known to exist and has been contacted successfully in the past, but is currently unreachable. 'Stopped' and 'Aborted' are similar, although the former implies a clean and orderly stop, while the latter implies an abrupt stop where the state and configuration of the element might need to be updated. 'Dormant' indicates that the element is inactive or quiesced. 'Supporting Entity in Error' indicates that this element might be 'OK' but that another element, on which it is dependent, is in error. An example is a network service or endpoint that cannot function due to lower-layer networking problems. 'Completed' indicates that the element has completed its operation. This value should be combined with either OK, Error, or Degraded so that a client can tell if the complete operation Completed with OK (passed), Completed with Error (failed), or Completed with Degraded (the operation finished, but it did not complete OK or did not report an error). 'Power Mode' indicates that the element has additional power model information contained in the Associated PowerManagementService association. OperationalStatus replaces the Status property on ManagedSystemElement to provide a consistent approach to enumerations, to address implementation needs for an array property, and to provide a migration path from today's environment to the future. This change was not made earlier because it required the deprecated qualifier. Due to the widespread use of the existing Status property in management applications, it is strongly recommended that providers or instrumentation provide both the Status and OperationalStatus properties. Further, the first value of OperationalStatus should contain the primary status for the element. When instrumented, Status (because it is single-valued) should also provide the primary status of the element."

This property is provided to compare the last requested and current enabled or disabled states. Note that when EnabledState is set to 5 ('Not Applicable'), then this property has no meaning. By default, the RequestedState of the element is 5 ('No Change'). Refer to the EnabledState property description for explanations of the values in the RequestedState enumeration. It should be noted that there are two new values in RequestedState that build on the statuses of EnabledState. These are 'Reboot' (10) and 'Reset' (11). Reboot refers to doing a 'Shut Down' and then moving to an 'Enabled' state. Reset indicates that the element is first 'Disabled' and then 'Enabled'. The distinction between requesting 'Shut Down' and 'Disabled' should also be noted. Shut Down requests an orderly transition to the Disabled state, and might involve removing power, to completely erase any existing state. The Disabled state requests an immediate disabling of the element, such that it will not execute or accept any commands or processing requests. This property is set as the result of a method invocation (such as Start or StopService on CIM_Service), or can be overridden and defined as WRITEable in a subclass. The method approach is considered superior to a WRITEable property, because it allows an explicit invocation of the operation and the return of a result code. A particular instance of EnabledLogicalElement might not support RequestedStateChange. If this occurs, the value 12 ('Not Applicable') is used."

This definition overcomes the limitation of describing status using a single value, when it is really a multi-valued property (for example, an element might be OK AND Stopped. 2) A MaxLen of 10 is too restrictive and leads to unclear enumerated values. 3) The change to a uint16 data type was discussed when CIM V2.0 was defined. However, existing V1.0 implementations used the string property and did not want to modify their code. Therefore, Status was grandfathered into the Schema. Use of the deprecated qualifier allows the maintenance of the existing property, but also permits an improved definition using OperationalStatus."

However, a few are not and are described here in more detail. 'Stressed' indicates that the element is functioning, but needs attention. Examples of 'Stressed' states are overload, overheated, and so on. 'Predictive Failure' indicates that an element is functioning nominally but predicting a failure in the near future. 'In Service' describes an element being configured, maintained, cleaned, or otherwise administered. 'No Contact' indicates that the monitoring system has knowledge of this element, but has never been able to establish communications with it. 'Lost Communication' indicates that the ManagedSystem Element is known to exist and has been contacted successfully in the past, but is currently unreachable. 'Stopped' and 'Aborted' are similar, although the former implies a clean and orderly stop, while the latter implies an abrupt stop where the state and configuration of the element might need to be updated. 'Dormant' indicates that the element is inactive or quiesced. 'Supporting Entity in Error' indicates that this element might be 'OK' but that another element, on which it is dependent, is in error. An example is a network service or endpoint that cannot function due to lower-layer networking problems. 'Completed' indicates that the element has completed its operation. This value should be combined with either OK, Error, or Degraded so that a client can tell if the complete operation Completed with OK (passed), Completed with Error (failed), or Completed with Degraded (the operation finished, but it did not complete OK or did not report an error). 'Power Mode' indicates that the element has additional power model information contained in the Associated PowerManagementService association. OperationalStatus replaces the Status property on ManagedSystemElement to provide a consistent approach to enumerations, to address implementation needs for an array property, and to provide a migration path from today's environment to the future. This change was not made earlier because it required the deprecated qualifier. Due to the widespread use of the existing Status property in management applications, it is strongly recommended that providers or instrumentation provide both the Status and OperationalStatus properties. Further, the first value of OperationalStatus should contain the primary status for the element. When instrumented, Status (because it is single-valued) should also provide the primary status of the element."

This property is provided to compare the last requested and current enabled or disabled states. Note that when EnabledState is set to 5 ('Not Applicable'), then this property has no meaning. By default, the RequestedState of the element is 5 ('No Change'). Refer to the EnabledState property description for explanations of the values in the RequestedState enumeration. It should be noted that there are two new values in RequestedState that build on the statuses of EnabledState. These are 'Reboot' (10) and 'Reset' (11). Reboot refers to doing a 'Shut Down' and then moving to an 'Enabled' state. Reset indicates that the element is first 'Disabled' and then 'Enabled'. The distinction between requesting 'Shut Down' and 'Disabled' should also be noted. Shut Down requests an orderly transition to the Disabled state, and might involve removing power, to completely erase any existing state. The Disabled state requests an immediate disabling of the element, such that it will not execute or accept any commands or processing requests. This property is set as the result of a method invocation (such as Start or StopService on CIM_Service), or can be overridden and defined as WRITEable in a subclass. The method approach is considered superior to a WRITEable property, because it allows an explicit invocation of the operation and the return of a result code. A particular instance of EnabledLogicalElement might not support RequestedStateChange. If this occurs, the value 12 ('Not Applicable') is used."

This decision will be re-evaluated and repositioned later. Deprecated description: Maximum time, in milliseconds, that a Device can run in a 'Quiesced' state. The state is defined in its Availability and AdditionalAvailability properties, where 'Quiesced' is conveyed by the value 21. What occurs at the end of the time limit is device-specific. The Device can unquiesce, can be offline, or can take other actions. A value of 0 indicates that a Device can remain quiesced indefinitely."

    "description": "Indicates the current statuses of the element. Various operational statuses are defined. Many of the enumeration's values are self-explanatory. However, a few are not and are described here in more detail. 'Stressed' indicates that the element is functioning, but needs attention. Examples of 'Stressed' states are overload, overheated, and so on. 'Predictive Failure' indicates that an element is functioning nominally but predicting a failure in the near future. 'In Service' describes an element being configured, maintained, cleaned, or otherwise administered. 'No Contact' indicates that the monitoring system has knowledge of this element, but has never been able to establish communications with it. 'Lost Communication' indicates that the ManagedSystem Element is known to exist and has been contacted successfully in the past, but is currently unreachable. 'Stopped' and 'Aborted' are similar, although the former implies a clean and orderly stop, while the latter implies an abrupt stop where the state and configuration of the element might need to be updated. 'Dormant' indicates that the element is inactive or quiesced. 'Supporting Entity in Error' indicates that this element might be 'OK' but that another element, on which it is dependent, is in error. An example is a network service or endpoint that cannot function due to lower-layer networking problems. 'Completed' indicates that the element has completed its operation. This value should be combined with either OK, Error, or Degraded so that a client can tell if the complete operation Completed with OK (passed), Completed with Error (failed), or Completed with Degraded (the operation finished, but it did not complete OK or did not report an error). 'Power Mode' indicates that the element has additional power model information contained in the Associated PowerManagementService association. OperationalStatus replaces the Status property on ManagedSystemElement to provide a consistent approach to enumerations, to address implementation needs for an array property, and to provide a migration path from today's environment to the future. This change was not made earlier because it required the deprecated qualifier. Due to the widespread use of the existing Status property in management applications, it is strongly recommended that providers or instrumentation provide both the Status and OperationalStatus properties. Further, the first value of OperationalStatus should contain the primary status for the element. When instrumented, Status (because it is single-valued) should also provide the primary status of the element."

By default, the RequestedState of the element is 5 ('No Change'). Refer to the EnabledState property description for explanations of the values in the RequestedState enumeration. It should be noted that there are two new values in RequestedState that build on the statuses of EnabledState. These are 'Reboot' (10) and 'Reset' (11). Reboot refers to doing a 'Shut Down' and then moving to an 'Enabled' state. Reset indicates that the element is first 'Disabled' and then 'Enabled'. The distinction between requesting 'Shut Down' and 'Disabled' should also be noted. Shut Down requests an orderly transition to the Disabled state, and might involve removing power, to completely erase any existing state. The Disabled state requests an immediate disabling of the element, such that it will not execute or accept any commands or processing requests. This property is set as the result of a method invocation (such as Start or StopService on CIM_Service), or can be overridden and defined as WRITEable in a subclass. The method approach is considered superior to a WRITEable property, because it allows an explicit invocation of the operation and the return of a result code. A particular instance of EnabledLogicalElement might not support RequestedStateChange. If this occurs, the value 12 ('Not Applicable') is used."

This definition overcomes the limitation of describing status using a single value, when it is really a multi-valued property (for example, an element might be OK AND Stopped. 2) A MaxLen of 10 is too restrictive and leads to unclear enumerated values. 3) The change to a uint16 data type was discussed when CIM V2.0 was defined. However, existing V1.0 implementations used the string property and did not want to modify their code. Therefore, Status was grandfathered into the Schema.

However, a few are not and are described here in more detail. 'Stressed' indicates that the element is functioning, but needs attention. Examples of 'Stressed' states are overload, overheated, and so on. 'Predictive Failure' indicates that an element is functioning nominally but predicting a failure in the near future. 'In Service' describes an element being configured, maintained, cleaned, or otherwise administered. 'No Contact' indicates that the monitoring system has knowledge of this element, but has never been able to establish communications with it. 'Lost Communication' indicates that the ManagedSystem Element is known to exist and has been contacted successfully in the past, but is currently unreachable. 'Stopped' and 'Aborted' are similar, although the former implies a clean and orderly stop, while the latter implies an abrupt stop where the state and configuration of the element might need to be updated. 'Dormant' indicates that the element is inactive or quiesced. 'Supporting Entity in Error' indicates that this element might be 'OK' but that another element, on which it is dependent, is in error. An example is a network service or endpoint that cannot function due to lower-layer networking problems. 'Completed' indicates that the element has completed its operation. This value should be combined with either OK, Error, or Degraded so that a client can tell if the complete operation Completed with OK (passed), Completed with Error (failed), or Completed with Degraded (the operation finished, but it did not complete OK or did not report an error). 'Power Mode' indicates that the element has additional power model information contained in the Associated PowerManagementService association. OperationalStatus replaces the Status property on ManagedSystemElement to provide a consistent approach to enumerations, to address implementation needs for an array property, and to provide a migration path from today's environment to the future. This change was not made earlier because it required the deprecated qualifier. Due to the widespread use of the existing Status property in management applications, it is strongly recommended that providers or instrumentation provide both the Status and OperationalStatus properties. Further, the first value of OperationalStatus should contain the primary status for the element. When instrumented, Status (because it is single-valued) should also provide the primary status of the element."

An example of a dedicated user device is a mobile phone or a barcode scanner in a store that communicates via radio frequency. These systems are quite limited in functionality and programmability, and are not considered 'general purpose' computing platforms. Alternately, an example of a mobile system that is 'general purpose' (i.e., is NOT dedicated) is a hand-held computer. Although limited in its programmability, new software can be downloaded and its functionality expanded by the user. A value of 'Management' indicates this instance is dedicated to hosting system management software. A value of 'Management Controller' indicates this instance represents specialized hardware dedicated to systems management (i.e., a Baseboard Management Controller (BMC) or service processor). The management scope of a 'Management Controller' is typically a single managed system in which it is contained. A value of 'Chassis Manager' indicates this instance represents a system dedicated to management of a blade chassis and its contained devices. This value would be used to represent a Shelf Controller. A 'Chassis Manager' is an aggregation point for management and may rely on subordinate management controllers for the management of constituent parts."

Test (7) indicates that the element is in a test state. Deferred (8) indicates that the element might be completing commands, but will queue any new requests. Quiesce (9) indicates that the element is enabled but in a restricted mode. The behavior of the element is similar to the Enabled state, but it processes only a restricted set of commands.

This property is deprecated in lieu of OperationalStatus, which includes the same semantics in its enumeration. This change is made for 3 reasons: 1) Status is more correctly defined as an array. This definition overcomes the limitation of describing status using a single value, when it is really a multi-valued property (for example, an element might be OK AND Stopped. 2) A MaxLen of 10 is too restrictive and leads to unclear enumerated values. 3) The change to a uint16 data type was discussed when CIM V2.0 was defined. However, existing V1.0 implementations used the string property and did not want to modify their code. Therefore, Status was grandfathered into the Schema. Use of the deprecated qualifier allows the maintenance of the existing property, but also permits an improved definition using OperationalStatus."

When using this algorithm, the first colon to appear in InstanceID must appear between <OrgID> and <LocalID>. <LocalID> is chosen by the business entity and should not be reused to identify different underlying (real-world) elements. If the above 'preferred' algorithm is not used, the defining entity must assure that the resulting InstanceID is not reused across any InstanceIDs produced by this or other providers for the NameSpace of this instance. For DMTF-defined instances, the 'preferred' algorithm must be used with the <OrgID> set to CIM."

'Stopped' and 'Aborted' are similar, although the former implies a clean and orderly stop, while the latter implies an abrupt stop where the state and configuration of the element might need to be updated. 'Dormant' indicates that the element is inactive or quiesced. 'Supporting Entity in Error' indicates that this element might be 'OK' but that another element, on which it is dependent, is in error. An example is a network service or endpoint that cannot function due to lower-layer networking problems. 'Completed' indicates that the element has completed its operation. This value should be combined with either OK, Error, or Degraded so that a client can tell if the complete operation Completed with OK (passed), Completed with Error (failed), or Completed with Degraded (the operation finished, but it did not complete OK or did not report an error). 'Power Mode' indicates that the element has additional power model information contained in the Associated PowerManagementService association. OperationalStatus replaces the Status property on ManagedSystemElement to provide a consistent approach to enumerations, to address implementation needs for an array property, and to provide a migration path from today's environment to the future. This change was not made earlier because it required the deprecated qualifier. Due to the widespread use of the existing Status property in management applications, it is strongly recommended that providers or instrumentation provide both the Status and OperationalStatus properties. Further, the first value of OperationalStatus should contain the primary status for the element. When instrumented, Status (because it is single-valued) should also provide the primary status of the element."

This definition overcomes the limitation of describing status using a single value, when it is really a multi-valued property (for example, an element might be OK AND Stopped. 2) A MaxLen of 10 is too restrictive and leads to unclear enumerated values. 3) The change to a uint16 data type was discussed when CIM V2.0 was defined. However, existing V1.0 implementations used the string property and did not want to modify their code. Therefore, Status was grandfathered into the Schema.

For example: If the managed element is a computer system, and the value of this flag is 'Is Next', then the setting will be effective next time the system resets. And, unless this flag is changed, it will persist for subsequent system resets. However, if this flag is set to 'Is Next For Single Use', then this setting will only be used once and the flag would be reset after that to 'Is Not Next'. So, in the above example, if the system reboots in a quick succession, the setting will not be used at the second reboot."

Execution of the Service may enhance or degrade the performance of the element. This may be as a side-effect of execution or as an intended consequence of methods provided by the Service. - Element Integrity (4): Deprecated in favor of 'Consumes', 'Enhances Integrity', or 'Degrades Integrity'. Execution of the Service may enhance or degrade the integrity of the element. This may be as a side-effect of execution or as an intended consequence of methods provided by the Service. - Manages (5): The Service manages the element. - Consumes (6): Execution of the Service consumes some or all of the associated element as a consequence of running the Service. For example, the Service may consume CPU cycles, which may affect performance, or Storage which may affect both performance and integrity. (For instance, the lack of free storage can degrade integrity by reducing the ability to save state. ) 'Consumes' may be used alone or in conjunction with other values, in particular, 'Degrades Performance' and 'Degrades Integrity'. 'Manages' and not 'Consumes' should be used to reflect allocation services that may be provided by a Service. - Enhances Integrity (7): The Service may enhance integrity of the associated element. - Degrades Integrity (8): The Service may degrade integrity of the associated element. - Enhances Performance (9): The Service may enhance performance of the associated element. - Degrades Performance (10): The Service may degrade performance of the associated element."

However, a few are not and are described here in more detail. 'Stressed' indicates that the element is functioning, but needs attention. Examples of 'Stressed' states are overload, overheated, and so on. 'Predictive Failure' indicates that an element is functioning nominally but predicting a failure in the near future. 'In Service' describes an element being configured, maintained, cleaned, or otherwise administered. 'No Contact' indicates that the monitoring system has knowledge of this element, but has never been able to establish communications with it. 'Lost Communication' indicates that the ManagedSystem Element is known to exist and has been contacted successfully in the past, but is currently unreachable. 'Stopped' and 'Aborted' are similar, although the former implies a clean and orderly stop, while the latter implies an abrupt stop where the state and configuration of the element might need to be updated. 'Dormant' indicates that the element is inactive or quiesced. 'Supporting Entity in Error' indicates that this element might be 'OK' but that another element, on which it is dependent, is in error. An example is a network service or endpoint that cannot function due to lower-layer networking problems. 'Completed' indicates that the element has completed its operation. This value should be combined with either OK, Error, or Degraded so that a client can tell if the complete operation Completed with OK (passed), Completed with Error (failed), or Completed with Degraded (the operation finished, but it did not complete OK or did not report an error). 'Power Mode' indicates that the element has additional power model information contained in the Associated PowerManagementService association. OperationalStatus replaces the Status property on ManagedSystemElement to provide a consistent approach to enumerations, to address implementation needs for an array property, and to provide a migration path from today's environment to the future. This change was not made earlier because it required the deprecated qualifier. Due to the widespread use of the existing Status property in management applications, it is strongly recommended that providers or instrumentation provide both the Status and OperationalStatus properties. Further, the first value of OperationalStatus should contain the primary status for the element. When instrumented, Status (because it is single-valued) should also provide the primary status of the element."

This property is provided to compare the last requested and current enabled or disabled states. Note that when EnabledState is set to 5 ('Not Applicable'), then this property has no meaning. By default, the RequestedState of the element is 5 ('No Change'). Refer to the EnabledState property description for explanations of the values in the RequestedState enumeration. It should be noted that there are two new values in RequestedState that build on the statuses of EnabledState. These are 'Reboot' (10) and 'Reset' (11). Reboot refers to doing a 'Shut Down' and then moving to an 'Enabled' state. Reset indicates that the element is first 'Disabled' and then 'Enabled'. The distinction between requesting 'Shut Down' and 'Disabled' should also be noted. Shut Down requests an orderly transition to the Disabled state, and might involve removing power, to completely erase any existing state. The Disabled state requests an immediate disabling of the element, such that it will not execute or accept any commands or processing requests. This property is set as the result of a method invocation (such as Start or StopService on CIM_Service), or can be overridden and defined as WRITEable in a subclass. The method approach is considered superior to a WRITEable property, because it allows an explicit invocation of the operation and the return of a result code. A particular instance of EnabledLogicalElement might not support RequestedStateChange. If this occurs, the value 12 ('Not Applicable') is used."
