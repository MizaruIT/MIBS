    "description": "This MIB module defines objects to manage Converged Data Link (CDL). CDL provides OAM&P (Operation, Administration, Maintenance and Provisioning) in Ethernet packet-based optical networks without a SONET/SDH layer. The CDL functionality can be divided into the following categories: APS/Defect Indications: The CDL frame carries defect indication bits and provides signalling mechanism support for automatic protection switching. Message Channel: The message channel is used to carry control (e.g. routing, signalling) and management traffic. Packet-by-packet multiplexing of multiple data flows: CDL uses one or two octets to identify the elementary packet stream that this packet belongs to. This allows more than one elementary packet stream to share the bandwidth on a CDL enabled interface. This MIB defines objects to manage Defect Indications and the Packet-by-packet Multiplexing feature. The CDL Message channel is modeled as a separate interface and should be controlled using the IF-MIB and other MIBs for managing IP. This MIB does not provide a mechanism to manage the CDL message channel. APS configuration and monitoring can be done using the CISCO-APS-MIB and CISCO-APS-EXT-MIB. "

This may be desirable at administrative boundaries between networks, for example, in order to limit the span of the hop-by-hop backward defect indication to the interface between the two networks. endOfAggPath: Indicates that this network element acts as a CDL Aggregate Path Terminating Network Element that terminates (generates in one direction and consumes in another direction) OAM information associated with an Aggregate Path (as well as OAM information associated with a Hop), at this interface. A network element will be designated an Aggregate Path Terminating network element at an interface only if it: (1) applies/removes the CDL Ethernet encapsulation, or (2) demultiplexes the arriving aggregate packet stream into elementary packet streams, and multiplexes two or more elementary packet streams into the departing packet stream. cdlRegenerator: A CDL Regenerator transmits a regenerated input packet stream.
