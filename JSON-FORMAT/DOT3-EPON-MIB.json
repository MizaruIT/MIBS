    "description": "A table of the extended package objects for queue management. The [802.3ah] MPCP defines a report message of the occupancy of the transmit queues for the feedback BW request from the ONUs. These queues serve the uplink transmission of the ONU and data is gathered there until the ONU is granted for transmission. The management table of the queues is added here mainly to control the reporting and to gather some statistics of their operation. This table is not duplicating existing management objects of bridging queues, specified in [802.1d], since the existence of a dedicated transmit queuing mechanism is implied in the [802.3ah], and the ONU may be a device that is not a bridge with embedded bridging queues. The format of the REPORT message, as specified in [802.3], is presented below: +-----------------------------------+ | Destination Address | +-----------------------------------+ | Source Address | +-----------------------------------+ | Length/Type | +-----------------------------------+ | OpCode | +-----------------------------------+ | TimeStamp | +-----------------------------------+ | Number of queue Sets | +-----------------------------------+ /|\\ | Report bitmap | | +-----------------------------------+ | | Queue 0 report | | +-----------------------------------+ | repeated for | Queue 1 report | | every +-----------------------------------+ | queue_set | Queue 2 report | | +-----------------------------------+ | | Queue 3 report | | +-----------------------------------+ | | Queue 4 report | | +-----------------------------------+ | | Queue 5 report | | +-----------------------------------+ | | Queue 6 report | | +-----------------------------------+ | | Queue 7 report | | +-----------------------------------+ \\|/ | Pad/reserved | +-----------------------------------+ | FCS | +-----------------------------------+ The 'Queue report' field reports the occupancy of each uplink transmission queue. The number of queue sets defines the number of the reported sets, as would be explained in the description of the dot3ExtPkgQueueSetsTable table. For each set the report bitmap defines which queue is present in the report, meaning that although the MPCP REPORT message can report up to 8 queues in a REPORT message, the actual number is flexible. The Queue table has a variable size that is limited by the dot3ExtPkgObjectReportMaximumNumQueues object, as an ONU can have fewer queues to report. The entries in the table are control and status indication objects for managing the queues of an EPON interface that are gathered in an extended package as an addition to the objects that are based on the [802.3ah] attributes. Each object has a row for every virtual link and for every queue in the report. The LLID field, as defined in the [802.3ah], is a 2-byte register (15-bit field and a broadcast bit) limiting the number of virtual links to 32768. Typically the number of expected virtual links in a PON is like the number of ONUs, which is 32-64, plus an additional entry for broadcast LLID (with a value of 0xffff). The number of queues is between 0 and 7 and limited by dot3ExtPkgObjectReportMaximumNumQueues."

The number of queue_sets defines the number of the reported sets, and it can reach a value of up to 8. It means that an ONU can hold a variable number of sets between 0 and 7. The dot3ExtPkgQueueSetsTable table has a variable queue_set size that is limited by the dot3ExtPkgObjectReportMaximumNumThreshold object as an ONU can have fewer queue_sets to report. The 'Queue report' field reports the occupancy of each uplink transmission queue. The queue_sets can be used to report the occupancy of the queues in a few levels as to allow granting, in an accurate manner, of only part of the data available in the queues. A Threshold is defined for each queue_set to define the level of the queue that is counted for the report of the occupancy. The threshold is reflected in the queue_set table by the dot3ExtPkgObjectReportThreshold object.
