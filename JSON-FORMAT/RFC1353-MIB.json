    "description": "The table contained in the local database which defines local MIB views. Each SNMP party has a single MIB view which is defined by two collections of view subtrees: the included view subtrees, and the excluded view subtrees. Every such subtree, both included and excluded, is defined in this table. To determine if a particular object instance is in a particular SNMP party's MIB view, compare the object instance's Object Identifier with each entry (for this party) in this table. If none match, then the object instance is not in the MIB view. If one or more match, then the object instance is included in, or excluded from, the MIB view according to the value of viewStatus in the entry whose value of viewSubtree has the most sub-identifiers. If multiple entries match and have the same number of sub-identifiers, then the lexicographically greatest instance of viewStatus determines the inclusion or exclusion. An object instance's Object Identifier X matches an entry in this table when the number of sub- identifiers in X is at least as many as in the value of viewSubtree for the entry, and each sub- identifier in the value of viewSubtree matches its corresponding sub-identifier in X. Two sub- identifiers match either if the corresponding bit of viewMask is zero (the 'wild card' value), or if they are equal. Due to this 'wild card' capability, we introduce the term, a 'family' of view subtrees, to refer to the set of subtrees defined by a particular combination of values of viewSubtree and viewMask. In the case where no 'wild card' is defined in viewMask, the family of view subtrees reduces to a single view subtree."

Each bit of this bit mask corresponds to a sub- identifier of viewSubtree, with the most significant bit of the i-th octet of this octet string value (extended if necessary, see below) corresponding to the (8*i - 7)-th sub-identifier, and the least significant bit of the i-th octet of this octet string corresponding to the (8*i)-th sub-identifier, where i is in the range 1 through 16. Each bit of this bit mask specifies whether or not the corresponding sub-identifiers must match when determining if an Object Identifier is in this family of view subtrees; a '1' indicates that an exact match must occur; a '0' indicates 'wild card', i.e., any sub-identifier value matches. Thus, the Object Identifier X of an object instance is contained in a family of view subtrees if the following criteria are met: for each sub-identifier of the value of viewSubtree, either: the i-th bit of viewMask is 0, or the i-th sub-identifier of X is equal to the i-th sub-identifier of the value of viewSubtree. If the value of this bit mask is M bits long and there are more than M sub-identifiers in the corresponding instance of viewSubtree, then the bit mask is extended with 1's to be the required length. Note that when the value of this object is the zero-length string, this extension rule results in a mask of all-1's being used (i.e., no 'wild card'), and the family of view subtrees is the one view subtree uniquely identified by the corresponding instance of viewSubtree."
