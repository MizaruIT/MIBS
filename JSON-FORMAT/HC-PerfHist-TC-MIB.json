    "description": "A gauge associated with a performance measurement in a current 15 minute measurement interval. The value of an object with an HCPerfCurrentCount syntax starts from zero and is increased when associated events occur, until the end of the 15 minute interval. At that time the value of the gauge is stored in the first 15 minute history interval, and the gauge is restarted at zero. In the case where the agent has no valid data available for the current interval, the corresponding object instance is not available and upon a retrieval request a corresponding error message shall be returned to indicate that this instance does not exist. This count represents a non-negative integer, which may increase or decrease, but shall never exceed 2^64-1 (18446744073709551615 decimal), nor fall below 0. The value of an object with HCPerfCurrentCount syntax assumes its maximum value whenever the underlying count exceeds 2^64-1. If the underlying count subsequently decreases below 2^64-1 (due, e.g., to a retroactive adjustment as a result of entering or exiting unavailable time), then the object's value also decreases. Note that this TC is not strictly supported in SMIv2, because the 'always increasing' and 'counter wrap' semantics associated with the Counter64 base type are not preserved. It is possible that management applications which rely solely upon the (Counter64) ASN.1 tag to determine object semantics will mistakenly operate upon objects of this type as they would for Counter64 objects. This textual convention represents a limited and short- term solution, and may be deprecated as a long term solution is defined and deployed to replace it."
