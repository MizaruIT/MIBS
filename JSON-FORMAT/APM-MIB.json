In other words, AppLocalIndex values assigned to entries in one table must not overlap with AppLocalIndex values assigned to entries in another table. Further, every protocolDirLocalIndex value registered by the agent automatically assigns the same value out of the AppLocalIndex number space. For example, if the protocolDirLocalIndex values { 1, 3, 5, 7 } have been assigned, and the apmHttpFilterAppLocalIndex values { 6, 8, 9 } have been assigned: - Assignment of new AppLocalIndex values must not use the values { 1, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 }. - AppLocalIndex values { 1, 3, 5, 7 } are automatically assigned and are associated with the identical value of protocolDirLocalIndex. In particular, an entry in the apmAppDirTable indexed by a value provides further information about a protocol indexed by the same value in the protocolDirTable of RMON2. The value for each supported application must remain constant at least from one re-initialization of the entity's network management system to the next re-initialization, except that if an application is deleted and re-created, it must be re-created with a new value that has not been used since the last re-initialization. The specific value is meaningful only within a given SNMP entity. An AppLocalIndex value must not be re-used until the next agent restart."

The entity that assigns the ClientID may use various implementation techniques to keep track of a client but if the assigning entity is unable to track client address mappings, it may map client identifiers to client addresses rather than to distinct client machines. This is named ClientID because it helps to solve a problem seen in network clients (servers usually have well-known, long-lived addresses).

The metrics for a single transaction are the responsiveness of the transaction and whether the transaction succeeded (a boolean). When such metrics are aggregated in this MIB Module, these metrics are replaced by averages and distributions of responsiveness and availability. The metrics describing aggregates are constant no matter which type of aggregation is being performed. These metrics may be found in the apmReportTable. The flows(1) aggregation is the simplest. All transactions that share common application/server/client 3-tuples are aggregated together, resulting in a set of metrics for all such unique 3-tuples. The clients(2) aggregation results in somewhat more aggregation (i.e., fewer resulting records). All transactions that share common application/client tuples are aggregated together, resulting in a set of metrics for all such unique tuples. The servers(3) aggregation usually results in still more aggregation (i.e., fewer resulting records). All transactions that share common application/server tuples are aggregated together, resulting in a set of metrics for all such unique tuples. The applications(4) aggregation results in the most aggregation (i.e., the fewest resulting records). All transactions that share a common application are aggregated together, resulting in a set of metrics for all such unique applications. Note that it is not meaningful to aggregate applications, as different applications have widely varying characteristics. As a result, this set of aggregations is complete."

If new entries are added to the apmHttpFilterTable or the apmUserDefinedAppTable, the agent will add the corresponding entries to this table. It is an implementation-dependent matter as to how the agent sets these default parameters. For example, it may leave certain entries in this table 'off(0)' if the agent developer believes that combination will be infrequently used, allowing a manager that needs that capability to set it to 'on(1)'. Some applications are registered in the RMON2 protocol directory and some are registered in other tables in this MIB Module. Regardless of where an application is originally registered, it is assigned an AppLocalIndex value that is the primary index for this table. The contents of this table affect all reports and exceptions generated by this agent. Accordingly, modification of this table should be performed by a manager acting in the role of administrator. In particular, management software should not require or enforce particular configuration of this table - it should reflect the preferences of the site administrator, not the software author. As a practical matter, this requires management software to allow the administrator to configure the values it will use so that it can be adapted to the site policy."

    "description": "This object describes and configures the agent's support for application performance measurement for this application. There are 3 types of measurements for different types of applications: Transaction-Oriented applications have a fairly constant workload to perform for all transactions. The responsiveness metric for transaction-oriented applications is application response time (from first request to final delivery of service) and is measured in milliseconds. This is commonly referred to as end-user response time. Throughput-Oriented applications have widely varying workloads based on the nature of the client request. In particular, throughput-oriented applications vary widely in the amount of data that must be transported to satisfy the request. The responsiveness metric for throughput-oriented applications is kilobits per second. Streaming-Oriented applications deliver data at a constant metered rate of speed regardless of the responsiveness of the networking and computing infrastructure. This constant rate of speed is generally specified to be below (sometimes well below) the nominal capability of the infrastructure. However, when the infrastructures cannot deliver data at this speed, interruption of service or degradation of service can result. The responsiveness metric for streaming-oriented applications is the ratio of time that the service is degraded or interrupted to the total service time. This metric is measured in parts per million. Note that for some applications, measuring more than one responsiveness type may be interesting. For agents that wish to support more than one measurement for a application, they will populate this table with multiple entries for that application, one for each type."

If the value of this object isn't 0.0, it signifies that the entire contents of the apmAppDirTable, apmHttpFilterTable, apmUserDefinedAppTable and protocolDirTable are equal to a known state identified by the value of this object. If a manager recognizes this value as identifying a directory configuration it has a local copy of, it may use this local copy rather than downloading these tables. Note that it may have downloaded this local copy (and the ID) from another agent and used this copy for all other agents that advertised the same ID. If an agent recognizes that the entire contents of the apmAppDirTable, apmHttpFilterTable, apmUserDefinedAppTable and protocolDirTable are equal to a known state to which an ID has been assigned, it should set this object to that ID. In many cases when this feature is used, the application directory information will be in read-only memory and thus the tables may not be modified via SNMP requests. In the event that the tables are writable and a modification is made, the agent is responsible for setting this object to 0.0 if it cannot determine that the state is equal to a known state. An agent is not obligated to recognize and advertise all such registered states as it may not have knowledge of all states. Thus, a manager may encounter agents whose DirectoryID value is 0.0 even though the contents of the directory were equal to a registered state. Note that the contents of those tables includes the protocolDirLocalIndex and appLocalIndex values. In other words, these values can't be assigned randomly on each agent, but must be equal to values that are part of the known state. While it is possible for a manager to download application directory details using SNMP and to set the appropriate directoryID, the manager would need to have some scheme to ensure consistent values of LocalIndex variables from agent to agent. Such schemes are outside the scope of this specification. Application directory registrations are unique within an administrative domain. Typically these registrations will be made by an agent software developer who will set the application directory tables to a read-only state and assign a DirectoryID to that state. Thus, all agents running this software would share the same DirectoryID. As the application directory might change from one software release to the next, the developer may register different DirectoryID's for each software release. A customer could also create a site-wide application directory configuration and assign a DirectoryID to that configuration as long as consistent values of LocalIndex variables can be ensured.

The apmNameTable assigns a long-lived identifier to a client and records what addresses were assigned to that client for periods of time. Various implementation techniques exist for tracking this mapping but if an agent is unable to track client address mappings, it may map client identifiers to client addresses rather than to distinct client machines. A particular apmNameClientID should be a constant attribute of a particular client. When available, the agent may also record the machine name and/or user name which may be valuable for displaying to humans. The apmNameMachineName and apmNameUserName are relatively constant, changing only if these attributes actually change on the client. The agent will store a historical log of these entries, aging out old entries as the log becomes too large. Since this table contains information vital to the interpretation of other tables (e.g., the apmReportTable), the agent should ensure that the log doesn't age out entries that would be referenced by data in those tables. Note that an entry for a clientID is active from its StartTime until the StartTime of another entry (for the same clientID) that supersedes it, or 'now' if none supersede it. Therefore, if a clientID only has a single entry, it is by definition very new and should never be aged out. No entry for a clientID should be aged out unless it has been updated by a new entry for the client (i.e., with an updated address) and only if the new entry is 'old' enough. To determine how old is old enough, compute the maximum value of Interval * (NumReports + 1) of all entries in the apmReportControlTable (the '+ 1' is to allow a reasonable period of time for the report to be downloaded). Then take the larger of this value and the age in seconds of the oldest entry in the current transaction table. If an entry for a clientID is superseded by another entry whose StartTime is more than this many seconds ago, then the older entry may be deleted."

For example, when downloading a very short file, a single dropped packet could double or triple the total response time. Further, throughput is usually examined for applications that transfer a lot of data, and when doing so it is helpful to conceptualize transaction costs that are proportional to the amount of data separately from those costs that are relatively fixed (i.e., independent of the amount of data). For very short transactions, these fixed transaction costs (handshake, setup time, authentication, round-trip time) may dominate the total response time for the transaction, resulting in throughput measurements that aren't really proportional to the network's, server's and client's combined data throughput capability. This object controls the minimum number of seconds that an throughput-based transaction must exceed before an exception can be generated for it. If this object is set to zero, then all throughput-based transactions are candidates for exceptions. The value of this object must persist across reboots."
