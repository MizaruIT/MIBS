The gateway waits for either the end of this timer, or the reception of call agent command or the detection of local user activity for the endpoint. When the disconnected timer elapses, or when a command is received from the call agent or when there is a local user activity, the Media Gateway sends the Restart In Progress command with the restart method as RM:disconnected to the Media Gateway Controller.

The endpoint in disconnected state starts the disconnected timer initialised to the random value and uniformly distributed between 1 and initial waiting delay (Tdinit) in seconds. The gateway waits for either the end of this timer, or the reception of call agent command or the detection of local user activity for the endpoint. When the disconnected timer elapses, or when a command is received from the call agent or when there is a local user activity, the Media Gateway sends the Restart In Progress command with the restart method as RM:disconnected to the Media Gateway Controller. In case of local user activity, a provisionable disconnected minimum waiting delay (Tdmin) must have been elapsed since the gateway became disconnected. The minimum waiting delay (Tdmin) timeout value used by the Media Gateway to send the Restart In Progress with the restart method as RM:disconnected to the Media Gateway Controller if there is any local user activity is defined by this object. Media Gateway initiated delete connection (DLCX) or restart in progress (RSIP) commands are not considered as local user activity. The events observed on the TDM interface or on the network constitute the local user activity. The recommended value of this object is 15 seconds. "

    "description": "The maximum waiting delay (Tdmax) timeout value used by the Media Gateway to send the Restart In Progress with the restart method as RM:disconnected to the Media Gateway Controller when the endpoint has become disconnected is defined by this object. The endpoint becomes disconnected when it tries to communicate with the call agent and the retransmission procedure times out after retrying. The endpoint in disconnected state starts the disconnected timer initialised to the random value and uniformly distributed between 1 and initial waiting delay (Tdinit) in seconds. The gateway waits for either the end of this timer, or the reception of call agent command or the detection of local user activity for the endpoint. When the disconnected timer elapses, or when a command is received from the call agent or when there is a local user activity, the Media Gateway sends the Restart In Progress command with the restart method as RM:disconnected to the Media Gateway Controller. If the disconnected procedure still left the endpoint disconnected, the disconnected timer is doubled subject to a provisionable disconnected maximum waiting delay (Tdmax) in seconds and the gateway starts the new disconnected procedure again. Once the maximum value is reached, the subsequent disconnected Restart In Progress commands use the maximum waiting delay (Tdmax). The recommended value of this object is 600 seconds. "
