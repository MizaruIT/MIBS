    "description": "This MIB module defines a set of basic objects for configuring middleboxes, such as firewalls and network address translators, in order to enable communication across these devices. Managed objects defined in this MIB module are structured in three kinds of objects: - transaction objects required according to the MIDCOM protocol requirements defined in RFC 3304 and according to the MIDCOM protocol semantics defined in RFC 3989, - configuration objects that can be used for retrieving or setting parameters of the implementation of transaction objects, - optional monitoring objects that provide information about used resource and statistics The transaction objects are organized in two subtrees: - objects modeling MIDCOM policy rules in the midcomRuleTable - objects modeling MIDCOM policy rule groups in the midcomGroupTable Note that typically, configuration objects are not intended to be written by MIDCOM clients. In general, write access to these objects needs to be restricted more strictly than write access to objects in the transaction subtrees. Copyright (C) The Internet Society (2008). This version of this MIB module is part of RFC 5190; see the RFC itself for full legal notices."
