    "description": "This is the MIB module for subscriber QoS monitoring for DOCSIS-compliant Cable Modem Termination Systems (CMTS). Several subscriber behavior can be monitored: 1. When the subscriber requests for more resources than as defined by its QoS parameter set. In this case, though requested for more rate-limiting happens in the CMTS, hence, the subscriber will get only as much resources as defined by its registered QoS parameter set. In this mib, QoS parameter set refers to QoS profiles for 1.0 modems and refer to service class names for 1.1 and 2.0 modems. 2. When the subscriber continuously utilizes the resources to the upper limit or very near to the upper limit as defined by its QoS parameter set. 3. When the subscriber sometimes or never utilizes the resources as defined by the upper limit of the QoS parameter set. In the first two cases, we need to monitor the subscribers as upstream/downstream is a shared medium, and if all subscribers start consuming resources as per their peak rate, or a percentage of it, CMTS will be hard pressed for resources. So, even though such subscribers are using resources within the limits as defined by their QoS parameter set, from the CMTS point of view, they are over consuming. Through out this MIB, we refer to this behavior of subscribers as over consumption of resources and such subscribers will be the violating subscribers. The subscriber QoS Monitoring is a software feature provided on the CMTS so that the CMTS may identify such subscribers who over consume resources based on their QoS parameter set, report them to a management entity, and automatically mitigate the problem where possible. This is done by penalizing the violating subscribers by changing their QoS parameter set to enforced QoS parameter set. The MIB allows to create enforce rules which are used to determine the over consumption of resources. The enforce rule contains monitoring and enforced QoS parameter set. The subscribers who over consume their bandwidth are flagged and NMS notified of all such violations. The MIB also provides a unified view of all over-consuming subscribers."

    "description": "This table contains the attributes of the QoS enforce rules present on the CMTS. These enforce rules define the criteria for identifying subscribers who over consume resources. This could be as simple as bytes transmitted over the last monitoring duration and checked at a rate equal to the sample rate. In the sliding window concept used, the monitoring duration is the size of the window. This window slides by an amount that is equal to the sample rate. At every sample rate the bytes transmitted in the time equal to a monitoring duration is checked. If this is found to be larger than the threshold limit which is calculated by multiplying the defined average rate by the monitoring duration per monitoring duration, the subscriber is flagged as over consuming. Else the monitoring will continue. For example let the monitoring duration be 360 minutes and sample rate be 30 minutes. If the average rate is 2kbits/sec then every 30 minutes we check if the bytes transmitted in the last 360 minutes exceeded 5.4Mbytes bytes. If so, the subscriber is over consuming. The enforce rule has a one to one mapping to QoS profiles in case of DOCSIS1.0 (and DOCSIS1.0+ modems) and to service class names in case of DOCSIS1.1 and DOCSIS2.0 modems. It defines the registered QoS parameter set and an enforced QoS parameter set be applied if found to be violating the registered QoS parameter set. The enforce rule also defines a penalty period for which the enforced QoS parameter set will be applied. The registered QoS parameter set will be restored when the penalty period expires. The monitoring can be of two types: 1) Legacy/Basic monitoring: There is only one threshold and one monitoring-duration and the monitoring-duration can be more than one day and within a day there is no distinction among hours as peak or offpeak hours. An example would be: monitoring duration : 2 days Average rate : 2kbits/sec 2) Peak-offPeak monitoring: A maximum of two peak durations can be defined with in a day and the remaining hours are treated as off-peak and the monitoring will happen during these offpeak hours if the offpeak duration and threhold are defined. The monitoring-duration and threshold for all three, first peak, second peak and offpeak can be different. Here, the monitoring duration for any of the peaks or offpeak cannot be more than a day. An example when both peaks and offpeak are defined is: First peak: monitoring duration: Between 6am to 9am i.e., 3hours Average rate : 2kbits/sec Second peak: monitoring duration: Between 6pm to 10pm i.e., 4hrs Average rate : 3kbits/sec Off peak: Remaining hours in the day i.e., 12 midnight to 6:00am, 9am to 6pm and 10pm to 12mignight. monitoring duration: 2 hours Average rate : 1kbits/sec."

Now, per sample memory consumption is 8 bytes hence approximately, the maximum number of samples that can be allowed are 10 * 10 ^ 6 / (6 * 10 ^ 3 * 2 * 8) ~ 100 Hence, given the duration the sample rate would be calculated as duration / 100 = sample rate only if the duration happens to be more than 1440.
