One entry exists for each past value of sysUpTime, except that the whole table is purged should sysUpTime wrap. As this basic row is updated new conceptual rows are created (which still share the now updated object values with all other instances).

Each new conceptual row will be associated with the timeMark instance which was created at the value of sysUpTime with which the conceptual row is to be associated.

The presence or absence of the `extensible' bit describes whether or not this protocol directory entry can be extended by the user by creating protocol directory entries which are children of this protocol. An example of an entry that will often allow extensibility is `ip.udp'. The probe may automatically populate some children of this node such as `ip.udp.snmp' and `ip.udp.dns'. A probe administrator or user may also populate additional children via remote SNMP requests that create entries in this table. When a child node is added for a protocol for which the probe has no built in support, extending a parent node (for which the probe does have built in support), that child node is not extendible. This is termed `limited extensibility'. When a child node is added through this extensibility mechanism, the values of protocolDirLocalIndex and protocolDirType shall be assigned by the agent. The other objects in the entry will be assigned by the manager who is creating the new entry. This object also describes whether or not this agent can recognize addresses for this protocol, should it be a network level protocol. That is, while a probe may be able to recognize packets of a particular network layer protocol and count them, it takes additional logic to be able to recognize the addresses in this protocol and to populate network layer or application layer tables with the addresses in this protocol. If this bit is set, the agent will recognize network layer addresses for this protoocl and populate the network and application layer host and matrix tables with these protocols. Note that when an entry is created, the agent will supply values for the bits that match the capabilities of the agent with respect to this protocol. Note that since row creations usually exercise the limited extensibility feature, these bits will usually be set to zero."

    "description": "This data type is used to communicate with a modem or a serial data switch. A ControlString contains embedded commands to control how the device will interact with the remote device through the serial interface. Commands are represented as two character sequences beginning with the `^' character. The following commands are recognized by the device (note that command characters are case sensitive): ^s Send string that follows which is terminated by the next command or the end of string. ^c Delay for the number of seconds that follows. Toss out any data received rather than storing it in a buffer for parsing. ^t Set timeout to the value represented by the decimal digits that follow. The default timeout is 20 seconds. Note that this timeout may be overridden by a smaller serialTimeout configured for the associated serial interface (see serialConfigTable). ^w Wait for the reply string that follows which is terminated by the next command or the end of string. Partial and case insensitive matching is applied, ie. if the reply string (any case combination) is found anywhere in the received string, then the a match is found. If the current timeout elapses without a match, then the remaining control string is ignored. ^! The ^ character. ^d Delay the number of seconds specified by the decimal digits that follow. ^b Send break for the number of milliseconds specified by the decimal digits that follow. If no digits follow, break will be enforced for 250 milliseconds by default. The following ASCII control characters may be inserted into the `^s' send string or the `^w' reply string: ^@ 0x00 ^A 0x01 .. ^M 0x0D .. ^Z 0x1A ^[ 0x1B ^ 0x1C ^] 0x1D ^^ 0x1E ^_ 0x1F Binary data may also be inserted into the data stream. The control sequence for each byte of binary data is ^0x##, where ## is the hexadecimal representation of the data byte. Two ASCII characters (0-9, a-f, A-F) must follow the `^0x' control prefix. For example, `^0x0D^0x0A' is interpreted as a carriage return followed by a line feed."

If either the netConfigIPAddress or netConfigSubnetMask are 0.0.0.0, then when the device boots, it may use BOOTP to try to figure out what these values should be. If BOOTP fails, before the device can talk on the network, this value must be configured (e.g., through a terminal attached to the device). If BOOTP is used, care should be taken to not send BOOTP broadcasts too frequently and to eventually send very infrequently if no replies are received."
