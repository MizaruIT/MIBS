Alarm types are used to identify if alarms indicate the same problem or not, for lookup into external alarm documentation, etc. A unique alarm type is identified using the combination of two instances of EriAlarmType. Different managed object types and instances can share alarm types. But if the same managed object reports the same alarm type, it is to be considered to be the same alarm state. The alarm type is a simplification of the different X.733 and 3GPP alarm IRP alarm correlation mechanisms based on EventType, ProbableCause, SpecificProblem and NotificationId."
