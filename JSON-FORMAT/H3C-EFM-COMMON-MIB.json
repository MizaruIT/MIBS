    "description": "The MIB module for managing the new Ethernet OAM features introduced by the Ethernet in the First Mile task force (IEEE 802.3ah). The functionality presented here is based on IEEE 802.3ah [802.3ah], released in October, 2004. In particular, this MIB focused on the changes to Clause 30 of the draft that are not specific to any physical layer. These changes are primarily reflected in the new OAM features developed under this project, that can be applied to any Ethernet like interface. The OAM features are described in Clause 57 of [802.3ah]. This mib is excerpted from the draft files directly,only changed the object name,added the h3c as prefix. The following reference is used throughout this MIB module: [802.3ah] refers to: IEEE Std 802.3ah-2004: 'Draft amendment to - Information technology - Telecommunications and information exchange between systems - Local and metropolitan are networks - Specific requirements - Part 3: Carrier sense multiple access with collision detection (CSMA/CD) access method and physical layer specifications - Media Access Control Parameters, Physical Layers and Management Parameters for subscriber access networks', October 2004. [802-2001] refers to: 'IEEE Standard for LAN/MAN (Local Area Network/Metropolitan Area Network): Overview and Architecture', IEEE 802, June 2001. Copyright (c) The Internet Society (2004).

    "description": "At initialization and failure conditions, two OAM entities on the same full-duplex Ethernet link begin a discovery phase to determine what OAM capabilities may be used on that link. The progress of this initialization is controlled by the OAM sublayer. This value is always disabled(1) if OAM is disabled on this interface via the h3cDot3OamAdminState. If the link has detected a fault and is transmitting OAMPDUs with a link fault indication, the value is linkFault(2). The passiveWait(3) state is returned only by OAM entities in passive mode (h3cDot3OamMode) and reflects the state in which the OAM entity is waiting to see if the peer device is OAM capable. The activeSendLocal(4) is used by active mode devices (h3cDot3OamMode) and reflects the OAM entity actively trying to discover whether the peer has OAM capability but has not yet made that determination. The state sendLocalAndRemote(5) reflects that the local OAM entity has discovered the peer but has not yet accepted or rejected the configuration of the peer. The local device can, for whatever reason, decide that the peer device is unacceptable and decline OAM peering. If the local OAM entity rejects the peer OAM entity, the state becomes oamPeeringLocallyRejected(7). If the OAM peering is allowed by the local device, the state moves to sendLocalAndRemoteOk(6). Note that both the sendLocalAndRemote(5) and oamPeeringLocallyRejected(7) states fall within the state SEND_LOCAL_REMOTE of the Discovery state diagram [802.3ah, Figure 57-5], with the difference being whether the local OAM client has actively rejected the peering or has just not indicated any decision yet. Whether a peering decision has been made is indicated via the local flags field in the OAMPDU (reflected in the aOAMLocalFlagsField of 30.3.6.1.10). If the remote OAM entity rejects the peering, the state becomes oamPeeringRemotelyRejected(8). Note that both the sendLocalAndRemoteOk(6) and oamPeeringRemotelyRejected(8) states fall within the state SEND_LOCAL_REMOTE_OK of the Discovery state diagram [802.3ah, Figure 57-5], with the difference being whether the remote OAM client has rejected the peering or has just not yet decided. This is indicated via the remote flags field in the OAM PDU (reflected in the aOAMRemoteFlagsField of 30.3.6.1.11). When the local OAM entity learns that both it and the remote OAM entity have accepted the peering, the state moves to operational(9) corresponding to the SEND_ANY state of the Discovery state diagram [802.3ah, Figure 57-5].

These two modes differ in that active mode provides additional capabilities to initiate monitoring activities with the remote OAM peer entity, while passive mode generally waits for the peer to initiate OAM actions with it. As an example, an active OAM entity can put the remote OAM entity in a loopback state, where a passive OAM entity cannot. Changing this value results in incrementing the configuration revision field of locally generated OAMPDUs (30.3.6.1.12) and potentially re-doing the OAM discovery process if the h3cDot3OamOperStatus was already operational(9).

This status is determined by a combination of the local parser and multiplexer states, the remote parser and multiplexer states, as well as by the actions of the local OAM client. When operating in normal mode with no loopback in progress, the status reads noLoopback(1). If the OAM client has sent an Loopback OAMPDU and is waiting for a response, where the local parser and multiplexer states are DISCARD (see [802.3ah, 57.2.11.1]), the status is 'initiatingLoopback'. In this case, the local OAM entity has yet to receive any acknowledgement that the remote OAM entity has received its loopback command request. If the local OAM client knows that the remote OAM entity is in loopback mode (via the remote state information as described in [802.3ah, 57.2.11.1, 30.3.6.1.15]), the status is remoteLoopback(3). If the local OAM client is in the process of terminating the remote loopback [802.3ah, 57.2.11.3, 30.3.6.1.14], with its local multiplexer and parser states in DISCARD, the status is terminatingLoopback(4). If the remote OAM client has put the local OAM entity in loopback mode as indicated by its local parser state, the status is localLoopback(5). The unknown(6) status indicates the parser and multiplexer combination is unexpected. This status may be returned if the OAM loopback is in a transition state but should not persist.
