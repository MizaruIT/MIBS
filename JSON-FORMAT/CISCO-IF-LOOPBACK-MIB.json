Upon receiving the loop activation request code, CPE enters a Line loop mode in which it returns the entire line back to the initiator. The CPE will continue to return the data back to the initiator until it receives a loopback deactivation request code. farEndPayloadLoopback(2): This loopback occurs at the CPE upon receiving a special code from the device which initiates the loopback. Upon receiving the loop activation request code, CPE enters a Payload loop mode in which it returns the Payload of the received data back to the initiator. The CPE will continue to return the data back to the initiator until it receives loopback deactivation request code. remoteLineLoopback(3): This loopback is established at the Near-end. In this loopback the entire line is looped back to the Far-end with a) bit-sequence integrity maintained, b) no change in framing, and c) no removal of bi- polar violations. remotePayloadLoopback(4): This loopback is established at the Near-end. In this loopback the signal that is returned to the Far-end consists of the payload of the received signal (with bit sequence integrity retained) and newly generated framing information. localLoopback(5): This is also known as metallic loopback. This loopback is used for checking the internal circuitry of the T3/E3, T1/E1 device. Only for physical lines. "

    "description": "This object specifies the type of the end device and the type of mechanism used to establish the loopback. Loopback type may not be modified once the farend loopback is established. Latching Loopback: Latching Loopback is appropriate with 64 kbit/s DS0-A rate. Once invoked by a specific activation sequence, it typically remains in effect until released by another specific code sequence. non-latching loopback: Non latching activation involves continuous transmission of loopback command codes, followed by test data interspersed with command codes. nonLatchOCUwithOneDevice(1): Non-latching OCU with one device. nonLatchOCUwithChainDevices(2): Non-latching OCU with chain of devices. nonLatchCSU(3): Non-latching CSU. nonLatchDSU(4): Non-latching DSU. latchDS0Drop(5): Latching DS0-DP Drop device. latchDS0Line(6): Latching DS0-DP line device. latchOCU(7): Latching OCU. latchCSU(8): Latching CSU. latchDSU(9): Latching DSU. latchDSU(9): Latching DSU . latchHL96(10): Latching HL96 device. v54PN127Polynomial(8): For fractional T1. This loopback is based on CCITT-ITU V.54 and is used to place either a single DS0 or a DS0 Bundle(N*DS0) in loopback mode. lineInband(12): This is used to loop back the entire T1 line at the far end. This is a repeating 5-bit pattern(00001), i.e. 00001000010001.... lineLoopbackESF(13): This loopback results in a full 1.544Mbit/s loopback of the incoming signal at the far end. The loopback is activated (latched) and deactivated by a bit sequence defined in ANSI T1.403 - 1995. This corresponds to Facility Data Link (FDL) loopbacks on a T1 channel. This causes a repeating, 16-bit ESF data link code word (00001110 11111111) to be sent to the remote end requesting that it enter into a network line loopback. payloadLoopbackESF(14): This loopback results in 1.536 Mbit/s loopback of the payload of the incoming signal at the far end. The loopback is activated(latched) and deactivated by a bit sequence defined in ANSI T1.403 - 1995. This corresponds to Facility Data Link (FDL) loopbacks on a T1 channel. This causes a repeating, 16-bit ESF data link code word (00010100 11111111) to be sent to the remote end requesting that it enter into a network payload loopback. noCode (15): LoopBack is on this device - NearEnd. lineLoopbackFEAC(16): The FEAC channel is used to request a line loopback at the Far-end. Loopback activate and de-activate are specified using the code-words specified in ANSI T1.404-1994. smartJackInband(17): Inband loop code for SmartJack (a Telco owned device that represents the demarcation point of T1 service), Ref: TR-TSY-000312"
