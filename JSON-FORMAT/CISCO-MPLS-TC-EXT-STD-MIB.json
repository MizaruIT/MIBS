It is expected that the Global_ID will be derived from the globally unique ASN of the autonomous system hosting the PEs containing the actual AIIs. The presence of a Global_ID based on the operator's ASN ensures that the AII will be globally unique. When the Global_ID is derived from a 2-octet AS number, the two high-order octets of this 4-octet identifier MUST be set to zero. Further ASN 0 is reserved. A Global_ID of zero means that no Global_ID is present. Note that a Global_ID of zero is limited to entities contained within a single operator and MUST NOT be used across an NNI. A non-zero Global_ID MUST be derived from an ASN owned by the operator."

The Local Identifier is configured between 1 and 16777215, as valid IP address range starts from 16777216(01.00.00.00). This range is chosen to identify the mplsTunnelTable's Ingress/Egress LSR-id is IP address or Local identifier, if the configured range is not IP address, administrator is expected to retrieve the complete information (Global_Node_ID or ICC) from mplsNodeConfigTable. This way, existing mplsTunnelTable is reused for bidirectional tunnel extensions for MPLS based transport networks. This Local Identifier allows the administrator to assign a unique identifier to map Global_Node_ID and/or ICC."
