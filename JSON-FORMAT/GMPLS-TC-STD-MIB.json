Where an LSP is signaled using a conventional signaling protocol, the 'head' of the LSP is the source of the signaling (also known as the ingress) and the 'tail' is the destination (also known as the egress). For unidirectional LSPs, this usually matches the direction of flow of data. For manually configured unidirectional LSPs, the direction of the LSP segment matches the direction of flow of data. For manually configured bidirectional LSPs, an arbitrary decision must be made about which LER is the 'head'."
