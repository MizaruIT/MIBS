    "description": "This data type is used to model an administratively assigned name of the owner of a resource. This information is taken from the NVT ASCII character set. It is suggested that this name contain one or more of the following: IP address, management station name, network manager's name, location, or phone number. In some cases the agent itself will be the owner of an entry. In these cases, this string shall be set to a string starting with 'monitor'. SNMP access control is articulated entirely in terms of the contents of MIB views; access to a particular SNMP object instance depends only upon its presence or absence in a particular MIB view and never upon its value or the value of related object instances. Thus, objects of this type afford resolution of resource contention only among cooperating managers; they realize no access control function with respect to uncooperative parties."
