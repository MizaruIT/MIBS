MIBs are typicially based here if they fall in one of two categories 1) are IETF work-in-process MIBs which have not been assigned a permanent object identifier by the IANA. 2) are shasta work-in-process which has not been assigned a permanent object identifier by the shasat assigned number authority, typicially because the mib is not ready for deployment. NOTE WELL: support for MIBs in the shastaExperiment subtree will be deleted when a permanent object identifier assignment is made."
