    "description": "This MIB is intended to be implemented on 802.11 Access Points and Wireless Bridges to provide information about the antennas connected to their 802.11 interfaces. The NMS retrieves the configured antenna parameters and uses it to calculate the recommended radio settings to be applied to the Access Points being managed to achieve optimum coverage and throughput. GLOSSARY Access Point ( AP ) An entity that contains an 802.11 medium access control ( MAC ) and physical layer ( PHY ) interface and provides access to the distribution services via the wireless medium for associated clients. Wireless Bridge An 802.11 entity that provides wireless connectivity between two wired LAN segments and is used in point- to-point or point-multipoint configurations. Repeater-AP A repeater is a 'wireless AP' that is attached to a parent AP on an 802.11 primary port. The Ethernet port is disabled in a Repeater-AP. Antenna A passive device connected to the 802.11 interface that is used for transmission and reception of the radio signals. Antennas transmit radio signals in all directions (omnidirectional) or in a particular direction(directional, high-gain). Antenna Gain The Antenna Gain is the measure of the amount of amplification done on the input radio signal by the antenna. Amplification is done by virtue of focussing the RF radiation into a tighter beam. Antenna Gain is expressed as dBi units. Attenuator An attenuator circuit allows a known source of power to be reduced by a predetermined factor usually expressed as decibels. This power reduction is achieved by the attenuator without introducing distortion. An attenuator may be used in either audio or radio signal circuits. "

    "description": "This object, expressed in dB, is used to calculate the appropriate radio settings for the wireless infrastructure devices being managed. The semantics are as follows. For a dot11 interface without an external antenna and an attenuator connected to it, the value of this object is the default gain corresponding to the PHY type of that respective interface. If the particular dot11 interface is connected to an external antenna in the presence of an attenuator, this object holds the value that is the resultant of the gain of the antenna as specified by the antenna's hardware specification and the attenuation introduced by the attenuator, as configured by the administrator. In the absence of an attenuator, the value held by this object is the exact value of the gain of the external antenna configured by the administrator as specified by the antenna's hardware specification, if an external antenna is connected to the 802.11 interface. In the absence of an external antenna, if the attenuator is present, the value of this object is is the amount of attenuation that is intended to be introduced to control the output power, as configured by the administrator. The value of this object is reverted back by the agent to the default gain corresponding to the PHY type of the particular 802.11 interface, when both the external antenna and the attenuator are physically disconnected from the particular interface and the gain configured earlier is cleared by the administrator.
