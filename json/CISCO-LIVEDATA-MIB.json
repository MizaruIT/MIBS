    "description": "Cisco LiveData is the next generation reporting product for Cisco Unified Contact Center Enterprise (CCE). Cisco LiveData provides a horizontally scalable, highly available architecture to support systems with large numbers of reporting users. LiveData enables fast refresh rates on real-time data (3 seconds or less). A LiveData node consumes real-time data streams from one or more sources, processes the data and publishes the resulting data to solution consumers. Consumers may be database management systems, applications or reporting engines. Cisco LiveData aggregates and publishes real-time data and metrics pushed to it (e.g. from the CCE router and/or peripheral gateway components) to a message bus; Cisco Unified Intelligence Center (CUIC) and the CCE Administrator Workstation (AW) subscribe to this message bus to receive real-time data updates. CUIC users then build reports using this real-time data; other CCE clients may also query this real-time data from the CCE AW database. A LiveData cluster consists of one or more nodes; one is designated as the master with additional worker nodes as needed. A LiveData cluster may have a remote peer cluster that works cooperatively in a fault-tolerant model. LiveData cluster peers communicate with one another to negotiate who is the 'active' cluster and who is on 'standby' (only one cluster will be active at a time). If the active cluster fails, the standby cluster will transition to active and begin consuming the data streams previously consumed by the peer cluster. In small deployments, a LiveData cluster will be collocated with CUIC in the same server virtual machine; in larger deployments, a LiveData cluster may include several nodes that may or may not be collocated with CUIC. A single node in a LiveData cluster will have multiple services running in the guest virtual machine that are critical to the successful function of that node. Services may be distributed across the nodes of a cluster to balance the workload. Each node will establish and maintain connections to data sources in the solution. CISCO-LIVEDATA-MIB defines instrumentation unique to the LiveData servers (virtual machines). The instrumentation includes objects of: 1) a general nature - attributes of the device and application, 2) cluster status* and identity, 3) service status and identity and 4) connection status and attributes (including metrics). 5) events * It is important to note that cluster status is shared across all nodes of a cluster; cluster status is not device-specific unless there is only one node in the cluster. The MIB also defines a single notification type; all nodes in all clusters may emit notifications. Service and connection instrumentation is exposed as tables. The number of entries within each table may change over time, adapting to changes within the cluster.

'alert': Events of this severity indicate that a devastating failure is imminent that will render the system unusable. Immediate operator attention is necessary. 'critical': Events of this severity indicate that a service-impacting failure is likely to occur soon which is the result of an error that was not appropriately handled by the system. Operator attention is needed as soon as possible. 'error': Events of this severity contain important operational state information and may indicate that the system has experienced a temporary impairment or an error that was appropriately handled by the system. An operator should review the notification soon as possible to determine if additional action is needed. 'warning': Events of this severity contain important operational state information that may be a precursor to an error occurrence. An operator should review the event soon to determine if additional action is needed. 'notice': Events of this severity contain health or operational state information that may be pertinent to the health of the system but do not require the immediate attention of the administrator. 'informational': Events of this severity contain interesting system-level information that is valuable to an administrator in time, however, the event itself does not indicate a fault or an impairment condition. 'debug': Events of this severity provide supplemental information that may be beneficial toward diagnosing or resolving a problem but do not necessarily provide operational health status."
