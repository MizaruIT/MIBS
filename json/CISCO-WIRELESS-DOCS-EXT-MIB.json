    "description": "To ensure fairness, at the upstream, the HE will throttle the rate of bandwidth grants, such that the flow never gets more than its provisioned peak rate in bps. Similarly at the downstream, HE controls the packets sent such that flow never gets more than its provisioned peak rate in bps. There are two directions for every Service Id (Sid) traffic: downstream and upstream. Each direction is called a service flow here and is assigned one token bucket with chosen algorithm. The enumerations for the rate limiting algorithm are: noRateLimit(1): The rate limiting is disabled. No rate limiting. oneSecBurst(2): Bursty 1 second token bucket algorithm. carLike(3) : Average token usage (CAR-like) algorithm wgtExPacketDiscard(4) : Weighted excess packet discard algorithm. shaping(5): token bucket algorithm with shaping Upstream supports all the above except wgtExtPacketDiscard(4). Downstream supports all the above rate-limiting algorithms. Token bucket algorithm with shaping is the default algorithm for upstream. Bursty 1 second token bucket algorithm is the default algorithm for downstream. Each algorithm is described as below: No rate limiting: The rate limiting process is disabled and no checking against the maximum bandwidth allowed. Bursty 1 second token bucket rate limiting algorithm: In this algorithm, at the start of every 1 second interval, a service flow's token usage is reset to 0, and every time the modem for that service flow sends a request (upstream) / packet (downstream) the upstream/downstream bandwidth token usage is incremented by the size of the request/packet sent. As long as the service flow's bandwidth token usage is less than the maximum bandwidth in bits per second (peak rate limit) its QoS service class allows, the request/packets will not be restricted. Once the service flow has sent more than its peak rate in the one second interval, it is prevented from sending more data by rejecting request (upstream) or dropping packets (downstream). This is expected to slow down the higher layer sources. The token usage counter gets reset to 0 after the 1 second interval has elapsed. The modem for that service flow is free to send more data up to the peak rate limit in the new 1 second interval that follows. Average token usage (Cisco CAR like) algorithm: This algorithm maintains a continuous average of the burst token usage of a service flow. There is no sudden refilling of tokens every 1 second interval. Every time a request/packet is to be handled, the scheduler tries to see how much time has elapsed since last transmission, and computes the number of tokens accumulated by this service flow at its QoS class peak rate. If burst usage of the service flow is less than tokens accumulated, the burst usage is reset to 0 and request/packet is forwarded. If the service flow has accumulated fewer tokens than its burst usage, the burst usage shows an outstanding balance usage after decrementing by the tokens accumulated. In such cases, the request/packet is still forwarded, provided the service flow's outstanding usage does not exceed peak rate limit of its QoS class. If outstanding burst usage exceeds the peak rate of the class, the service flow is given some token credit up to a certain maximum credit limit and the request/packet is forwarded. The request/packet is dropped when outstanding usage exceeds peak rate and maximum credit has been used up by this service flow. This algorithm tracks long term average bandwidth usage of the service flow and controls this average usage at the peak rate limit. Weighted excess packet discard algorithm: This rate limiting algorithm is only available as an option for downstream rate limiting. The algorithm is to maintain an weighted exponential moving average of the loss rate of a service flow over time. The loss rate, expressed in packets, represents the number of packets that can be sent from this service flow in a one second interval before a packet will be dropped. At every one second interval, the loss rate gets updated using the ratio between the flow peak rate (in bps) in its QoS profile and the service flow actual usage (in bps). If the service flow begins to send more than its peak rate continuously, the number of packets it can send in an one second interval before experiencing a drop will slowly keep reducing until SU for that service flow slows down as indicated by actual usage less or equal to the peak rate. Token bucket algorithm with shaping: If there is no QoS class peak rate limit, forward the request/packet without delay. If there is a QoS peak rate limit, every time a request/packet is to be handled, the scheduler determines the number of bandwidth tokens that this service flow has accumulated over the elapsed time at its QoS class peak rate and increments the tokens counter of the service flow accordingly. The scheduler limits the token count to the maximum transmit burst (token bucket depth). If token count is greater than the number of tokens required to handle current request/packet, decrement token count by size of request/packet and forwards the request/packet without delay. If token count is less than the size of request/packet, compute the shaping delay time after which the deficit number of tokens would be available. If shaping delay time is less than the maximum shaping delay, decrement tokens count by size of request/packet and forward this request/packet with the shaping delay in the shaping delay queue. When the delay time expires, the request/packet is forwarded. If shaping delay time is greater than the maximum shaping delay that the subsequent shaper can handle, the request/packet is dropped. Users can use cwdxQosIfRateLimitShpMaxDelay to configure the maximum shaping delay and cwdxQosIfRateLimitShpGranularity to configure the shaping granularity."

If the max buffering delay is large, then grants/packets of the flow will be buffered for a longer period of time even though the flow is rate exceeded. This means fewer chances of drops for such rate exceeded flow. However, too large a max shaping delay can result in quick drainage of packet buffers at the HE, since several packets will be in the shaping (delay) queue waiting for their proper transmission time. Another important point to note is that delaying a flow's packets (especially TCP flows) for extended periods of time may be counter- productive, since the higher protocol layers may assume a packet loss after a certain amount of time. The maximum shaping delay is only applied to rate limit algorithm: Token bucket algorithm with shaping.

    "description": "An HE operation entry to instruct a Subscriber-unit to move to a new downstream and/or upstream channel. There can be more than one entry per Subscriber-unit, so there is a time stamp for each entry to show the time when this operation is initiated. A management station wishing to create an entry should first generate a pseudo-random serial number to be used as the index to this sparse table. The station should then create the associated instance of the row status object. It must also, either in the same or in successive PDUs, create the associated instance of the command and parameter objects. It should also modify the default values for any of the parameter objects if the defaults are not appropriate. Once the appropriate instances of all the command objects have been created, either by an explicit SNMP set request or by default, the row status should be set to active to initiate the operation. Note that this entire procedure may be initiated via a single set request which specifies a row status of createAndGo as well as specifies valid values for the non-defaulted parameter objects. Once an operation has been activated, it cannot be stopped. That is, it will run until either the HE has generated downstream frequency and/or upstream channel override fields in the RNG-RSP message sent to a Subscriber-unit or time out. In either case, the operation is completed. During this time the row cannot be destroyed. Once the operation is completed, the real result of the operation to the Subscriber-unit cannot be known from this table. The result of the Subscriber-unit's downstream frequency and the upstream channel id can be checked from other MIB tables. For example, cwdIfHeServiceTable from CISCO-WIRELESS-DOCS-IF-MIB can be used to check whether the Subscriber-unit's downstream frequency and upstream channel id are changed. Please note that even though HE has generated downstream frequency and/or upstream channel override fields in the RNG-RSP message sent to a SUs if the SU cannot lock at the instructed downstream frequency or no upstream channel id could be used, it may reconnect back to the original downstream frequency and upstream channel id. Once the operation completes, the management station should retrieve the values of the cwdxHeSuChOverState objects of interest, and should then delete the entry. In order to prevent old entries from clogging the table, entries will be aged out, but an entry will never be deleted within 15 minutes of completing."
