    "description": "A MIB Module for managing the roles that are common between access methods like Command Line Interface (CLI), SNMP and XML interface. This MIB is an extension to the CISCO-COMMON-ROLES-MIB, which is for managing Common Roles on a device with fixed feature. Terminology: Commands are the basic operations that can be performed on a device. For example 'show aaa *', 'clear aaa *', 'config t; ip arp *'. Commands can be organized into groups called Features. Features can be organized into groups called Feature Groups. The constituents of a Feature (i.e. Commands) and the constituents of a Feature Group (i.e. Features) are collectively referred to as Feature Elements. This MIB extends the CISCO-COMMON-ROLES-MIB by adding the following. Features can be organized into groups called feature groups. Access privileges can be assigned to feature group(s) associated with a Role. The five access privileges (clear, config, debug, show & exec) are replaced by two access privileges ('read' and 'readWrite'). These two privileges have no relation to the replaced five privileges. The types of objects to which access can be restricted is extended to include VLANs and Interfaces. A device implementing this MIB need not implement CISCO-COMMON-ROLES-MIB."
