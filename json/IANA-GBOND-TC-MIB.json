    "description": "This MIB module defines IANAgBondScheme and IANAgBondSchemeList TEXTUAL-CONVENTIONs, specifying enumerated values of the gBondPortConfAdminScheme, gBondPortConfPeerAdminScheme, gBondPortStatOperScheme, gBondPortStatPeerOperScheme, gBondPortCapSchemesSupported, and gBondPortCapPeerSchemesSupported objects, respectively, as defined in the GBOND-MIB. It is intended that each new bonding scheme defined by the ITU-T Q4/SG15 working group and approved for publication in a revision of the ITU-T G.998 specification will be added to this MIB module, provided that it is suitable for being managed by the base objects in the GBOND-MIB. An Expert Review, as defined in RFC 5226, is REQUIRED for such additions. The following references are used throughout this MIB module: [G.998.1] refers to: ITU-T Recommendation G.998.1: 'ATM-based multi-pair bonding', January 2005. [G.998.2] refers to: ITU-T Recommendation G.998.2: 'Ethernet-based multi-pair bonding', January 2005. [G.998.3] refers to: ITU-T Recommendation G.998.3: 'Multi-pair bonding using time-division inverse multiplexing', January 2005. Naming Conventions: BCE - Bonding Channel Entity GBS - Generic Bonding Sub-layer These references should be updated as appropriate when a new bonding scheme is added to this MIB module.
