    "description": "The MIB module for management of network clock distribution and the Network Clock Distribution Protocol (NCDP) in Cisco devices. In the context of this MIB 'network clock' refers to the clock signal that is used to time the physical interfaces. Network clock distribution refers to the distribution of a clock signal through a device and between devices for use by the physical interfaces. (See Bell Communications Research, GR-1244-CORE, 'Clocks for the Synchronized Network: Common Generic Criteria' and Bell Communications Research, GR-436-CORE, 'Digital Network Synchronization Plan'). NCDP is used to configure the network clocking hardware of the platform on which an NCDP entity exists. The underlying network clocking hardware in turn distributes a clock signal through the device for use by the physical interfaces. When all of the interfaces that support synchronous clock recovery in a network are timed to one master clock signal, the network is said to be synchronized. NCDP protocol entities residing on adjacent devices cooperate through the exchange of protocol messages to construct a spanning network clock distribution tree. The tree preserves the synchronous digital hierarchy. After NCDP has determined that its algorithm has converged it superimposes the clock distribution tree on the underlying network and the result is a synchronized network."

A source of network clock for the device may be an oscillator local to the device, a Building Integrated Timing Supply (BITS) port or an interface that supports synchronous clock recovery. (BITS is explained in more detail in Bell Communications Research, GR-436-CORE, 'Digital Network Synchronization Plan'.) The NCDP protocol entity selects one entry in this table to advertise as the best available clock source for the device. Cooperating NCDP protocol entities select the best available clock source among those advertised within the cooperating group and build a clock distribution tree rooted at that clock source. When the value of cncRootClockSource is used as an index into this table and the indicated clock source has cncNcdpBestClockSource with value 'true' then the indicated clock source is the root of some clock distribution tree. If only one such root exists on all participating devices in the network, then it is the root of a network wide clock distribution tree. When the managed system initializes it creates a row for the device's default source of network clock. This row cannot be destroyed by a management station. Within this row a write operation is only allowed on the cncNcdpPriority object; only read operations are allowed on all other columnar objects within this specific row. The status of this row is always active. The default source can always be found by issuing a read operation on the row within cncManualSourceTable indexed by 'default' (as the value of cncManualSourcePriority). The cncManualSourceId object contains the entPhysicalIndex of the default source of network clock and identifies it within this table. Other rows are created or destroyed by a management station or through the device's local management interface when a source of network clock is configured or removed. When a management station creates a row it creates it explicitly using RowStatus with either createAndGo or createAndWait. A row is not made active until all read-create objects not having default values are properly initialized. The values of cncNcdpPriority, cncNcdpStratum and cncNcdpPRSReference collectively describe a source of network clock, that is they are three components of a vector used as an input to the NCDP algorithm to make clock source selection decisions.
