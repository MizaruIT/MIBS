    "description": "This MIB module defines the managed objects that support monitoring of thresholds on interfaces. Configuration and monitoring of the thresholds is done through threshold templates that can be assigned to any subset of interfaces on the network element. More than one threshold template can be assigned to a given interface. This MIB module should be used when it is desired to apply a common set of thresholds to a subset of the available interfaces. If a threshold is to be applied to only one interface, then the EVENT-MIB or the RMON-MIB may be used as simpler alternatives. If a threshold is to be applied to all available interfaces, then the EVENT-MIB may be used as a simpler alternative."
