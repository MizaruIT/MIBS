    "description": "The MIB module for managing the new Ethernet OAM features introduced by the Ethernet in the First Mile taskforce (IEEE 802.3ah). The functionality presented here is based on IEEE 802.3ah [802.3ah], released in October, 2004. [802.3ah] was prepared as an addendum to the standing version of IEEE 802.3 [802.3-2002]. Since then, [802.3ah] has been merged into the base IEEE 802.3 specification in [802.3-2005]. In particular, this MIB focuses on the new OAM functions introduced in Clause 57 of [802.3ah]. The OAM functionality of Clause 57 is controlled by new management attributes introduced in Clause 30 of [802.3ah]. The OAM functions are not specific to any particular Ethernet physical layer, and can be generically applied to any Ethernet interface of [802.3-2002]. An Ethernet OAM protocol data unit is a valid Ethernet frame with a destination MAC address equal to the reserved MAC address for Slow Protocols (See 43B of [802.3ah]), a lengthOrType field equal to the reserved type for Slow Protocols, and a Slow Protocols subtype equal to that of the subtype reserved for Ethernet OAM. OAMPDU is used throughout this document as an abbreviation for Ethernet OAM protocol data unit. The following reference is used throughout this MIB module: [802.3ah] refers to: IEEE Std 802.3ah-2004: 'Draft amendment to - Information technology - Telecommunications and information exchange between systems - Local and metropolitan area networks - Specific requirements - Part 3: Carrier sense multiple access with collision detection (CSMA/CD) access method and physical layer specifications - Media Access Control Parameters, Physical Layers and Management Parameters for subscriber access networks', October 2004. [802.3-2002] refers to: IEEE Std 802.3-2002: 'Information technology - Telecommunications and information exchange between systems - Local and metropolitan area networks - Specific requirements - Part 3: Carrier sense multiple access with collision detection (CSMA/CD) access method and physical layer specifications - Media Access Control Parameters, Physical Layers and Management Parameters for subscriber access networks', March 2002.

    "description": "At initialization and failure conditions, two OAM entities on the same full-duplex Ethernet link begin a discovery phase to determine what OAM capabilities may be used on that link. The progress of this initialization is controlled by the OA sublayer. This value is always disabled(1) if OAM is disabled on this interface via the dot3OamAdminState. If the link has detected a fault and is transmitting OAMPDUs with a link fault indication, the value is linkFault(2). Also, if the interface is not operational (ifOperStatus is not up(1)), linkFault(2) is returned. Note that the object ifOperStatus may not be up(1) as a result of link failure or administrative action (ifAdminState being down(2) or testing(3)). The passiveWait(3) state is returned only by OAM entities in passive mode (dot3OamMode) and reflects the state in which the OAM entity is waiting to see if the peer device is OA capable. The activeSendLocal(4) value is used by active mode devices (dot3OamMode) and reflects the OAM entity actively trying to discover whether the peer has OAM capability but has not yet made that determination. The state sendLocalAndRemote(5) reflects that the local OA entity has discovered the peer but has not yet accepted or rejected the configuration of the peer. The local device can, for whatever reason, decide that the peer device is unacceptable and decline OAM peering. If the local OAM entity rejects the peer OAM entity, the state becomes oamPeeringLocallyRejected(7). If the OAM peering is allowed by the local device, the state moves to sendLocalAndRemoteOk(6). Note that both the sendLocalAndRemote(5) and oamPeeringLocallyRejected(7) states fall within the state SEND_LOCAL_REMOTE of the Discovery state diagram [802.3ah, Figure 57-5], with the difference being whether the local OAM client has actively rejected the peering or has just not indicated any decision yet. Whether a peering decision has been made is indicated via the local flags field in the OAMPDU (reflected in the aOAMLocalFlagsField of 30.3.6.1.10). If the remote OAM entity rejects the peering, the state becomes oamPeeringRemotelyRejected(8). Note that both the sendLocalAndRemoteOk(6) and oamPeeringRemotelyRejected(8) states fall within the state SEND_LOCAL_REMOTE_OK of the Discovery state diagram [802.3ah, Figure 57-5], with the difference being whether the remote OAM client has rejected the peering or has just not yet decided. This is indicated via the remote flags field in the OAMPDU (reflected in the aOAMRemoteFlagsField of 30.3.6.1.11). When the local OAM entity learns that both it and the remote OAM entity have accepted the peering, the state moves to operational(9) corresponding to the SEND_ANY state of the Discovery state diagram [802.3ah, Figure 57-5]. Since Ethernet OAM functions are not designed to work completely over half-duplex interfaces, the value nonOperHalfDuplex(10) is returned whenever Ethernet OAM is enabled (dot3OamAdminState is enabled(1)), but the interface is in half-duplex operation.

These two modes differ in that active mode provides additional capabilities to initiate monitoring activities with the remote OAM peer entity, while passive mode generally waits for the peer to initiate OA actions with it. As an example, an active OAM entity can put the remote OAM entity in a loopback state, where a passive OA entity cannot. The default value of dot3OamMode is dependent on the type of system on which this Ethernet-like interface resides. The default value should be 'active(2)' unless it is known that this system should take on a subservient role to the other device connected over this interface. Changing this value results in incrementing the configuration revision field of locally generated OAMPDUs (30.3.6.1.12) and potentially re-doing the OAM discovery process if the dot3OamOperStatus was already operational(9).

    "description": "The loopback status of the OAM entity. This status is determined by a combination of the local parser and multiplexer states, the remote parser and multiplexer states, as well as by the actions of the local OAM client. When operating in normal mode with no loopback in progress, the status reads noLoopback(1). The values initiatingLoopback(2) and terminatingLoopback(4) can be read or written. The other values can only be read - they can never be written. Writing initiatingLoopback causes the local OAM entity to start the loopback process with its peer. This value can only be written when the status is noLoopback(1). Writing the value initiatingLoopback(2) in any other state has no effect. When in remoteLoopback(3), writing terminatingLoopback(4) causes the local OAM entity to initiate the termination of the loopback state. Writing terminatingLoopack(4) in any other state has no effect. If the OAM client initiates a loopback and has sent a Loopback OAMPDU and is waiting for a response, where the local parser and multiplexer states are DISCARD (see [802.3ah, 57.2.11.1]), the status is 'initiatingLoopback'. In this case, the local OAM entity has yet to receive any acknowledgment that the remote OAM entity has received its loopback command request. If the local OAM client knows that the remote OAM entity is in loopback mode (via the remote state information as described in [802.3ah, 57.2.11.1, 30.3.6.1.15]), the status is remoteLoopback(3). If the local OAM client is in the process of terminating the remote loopback [802.3ah, 57.2.11.3, 30.3.6.1.14] with its local multiplexer and parser states in DISCARD, the status is terminatingLoopback(4). If the remote OAM client has put the local OAM entity in loopback mode as indicated by its local parser state, the status is localLoopback(5). The unknown(6) status indicates that the parser and multiplexer combination is unexpected. This status may be returned if the OAM loopback is in a transition state but should not persist.

Generated when the number of frame errors exceeds a threshold within a given window defined by a period of time (for example, 10 frames in 1 second had errors). - Errored Frame Seconds Summary Event. Generated when the number of errored frame seconds exceeds a threshold within a given time period (for example, 10 errored frame seconds within the last 100 seconds). An errored frame second is defined as a 1 second interval which had >0 frame errors. There are other events (dying gasp, critical events) that are not threshold crossing events but which can be enabled/disabled via this table. "

When the OUI is the IEEE 802.3 OUI of 0x0180C2, the following event types are defined: erroredSymbolEvent(1), erroredFramePeriodEvent(2), erroredFrameEvent(3), erroredFrameSecondsEvent(4), linkFault(256), dyingGaspEvent(257), criticalLinkEvent(258) The first four are considered threshold crossing events, as they are generated when a metric exceeds a given value within a specified window. The other three are not threshold crossing events. When the OUI is not 71874 (0x0180C2 in hex), then some other organization has defined the event space. If event subtyping is known to the implementation, it may be reflected here. Otherwise, this value should return all F's (2^32 - 1). "
