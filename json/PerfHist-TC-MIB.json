The value of this counter starts from zero and is increased when associated events occur, until the end of the 15 minute interval. At that time the value of the counter is stored in the first 15 minute history interval, and the CurrentCount is restarted at zero. In the case where the agent has no valid data available for the current interval the corresponding object instance is not available and upon a retrieval request a corresponding error message shall be returned to indicate that this instance does not exist (for example, a noSuchName error for SNMPv1 and a noSuchInstance for SNMPv2 GET operation)."

In a system supporting a history of n intervals with IntervalCount(1) and IntervalCount(n) the most and least recent intervals respectively, the following applies at the end of a 15 minute interval: - discard the value of IntervalCount(n) - the value of IntervalCount(i) becomes that of IntervalCount(i-1) for n >= i > 1 - the value of IntervalCount(1) becomes that of CurrentCount - the TotalCount, if supported, is adjusted."
