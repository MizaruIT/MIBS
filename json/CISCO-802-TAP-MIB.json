The same data stream may be required by multiple taps, and one might assume that often the intercepted stream is a small subset of the traffic that could be intercepted. This essentially provides options for packet selection, only some of which might be used. For example, if all traffic to or from a given interface is to be intercepted, one would configure an entry which lists the interface, and wild-card everything else. If all traffic to or from a given MAC Address is to be intercepted, one would configure two such entries listing the MAC Address as source and destination respectively, and wild-card everything else. The first index indicates which Mediation Device the intercepted traffic will be diverted to. The second index permits multiple classifiers to be used together, such as having a MAC address as source or destination. Entries are added to this table via c802tapStreamStatus in accordance with the RowStatus convention."

If this is the only parameter specified, and it is other than -1 or 0, all traffic on the selected interface will be chosen. If the value is zero, matching traffic may be received or transmitted on any interface. Additional selection parameters must be selected to limit the scope of traffic intercepted. This is most useful on non-routing platforms or on intercepts placed elsewhere than a subscriber interface. If the value is -1, one or both of c802tapStreamDestinationAddress and c802tapStreamSourceAddress must be specified. Matching traffic on the interface pointed to by the dot1dTpFdbPort values associated with those values is intercepted, whichever is specified. If dot1dTpFdbPort changes, either by operator action or by protocol events, the interface will change with it. This is primarily intended for use on subscriber interfaces and other places where routing is guaranteed to be symmetrical. In both of these cases, it is possible to have the same packet selected for intersection on both its ingress and egress interface. Nonetheless, only one instance of the packet is sent to the Mediation Device. This value must be set when creating a stream entry, either to select an interface, to select all interfaces, or to select the interface that bridging learns. Some platforms may not implement the entire range of options."
