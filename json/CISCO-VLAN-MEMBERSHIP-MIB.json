The port is always assigned to one or more VLANs and the object may not be set so that there are no vlans assigned. Each octet within the value of this object specifies a set of eight VLANs, with the first octet specifying VLAN id 3072 through 3079, the second octet specifying VLAN ids 3040 through 3047, etc. Within each octet, the most significant bit represents the lowest numbered VLAN id, and the least significant bit represents the highest numbered VLAN id. Thus, each VLAN of the port is represented by a single bit within the value of this object. If that bit has a value of '1' then that VLAN is included in the set of VLANs; the VLAN is not included if its bit has a value of '0'."
