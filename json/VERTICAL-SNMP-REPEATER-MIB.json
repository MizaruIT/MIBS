This action does not reset the management counters defined in this document nor does it affect the portAdminStatus parameters. Included in this action is the execution of a disruptive Self-Test with the following characteristics: a) The nature of the tests is not specified. b) The test resets the repeater but without affecting management information about the repeater. c) The test does not inject packets onto any segment. d) Packets received during the test may or may not be transferred. e) The test does not interfere with management functions.

    "description": "The total number of octets contained in the valid frames that have been received on the ports in this repeater, modulo 2**32. That is, it contains the upper 32 bits of a 64-bit counter, of which the lower 32 bits are contained in the rptrMonTotalOctets object. If an implementation can not obtain a count of octets as seen by the repeater itself, the 64-bit value may be the summation of the values of the rptrMonitorPortReadableOctets counters combined with the corresponding rptrMonitorPortUpper32Octets counters for all of the ports in the repeater. This statistic provides an indicator of the total data transferred within the repeater. This two-counter mechanism is provided for those network management protocols that do not support 64-bit counters (e.g. SNMP V1) and are used to manage a repeater type of 100Mb/s. Conformance clauses for this MIB are defined such that implementation of this object is not required in a system which does not support 100Mb/s. However, systems with mixed 10 and 100Mb/s ports may implement this object across all ports, including 10Mb/s. If this object is implemented, it must be according to the definition in the first paragraph of this description; that is, the value of this object MUST be a valid count."
