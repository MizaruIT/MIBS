    "description": "This textual convention enumerates the Facilities that originate syslog messages. The Facilities of syslog messages are numerically coded with decimal values. For interoperability and backwards- compatibility reasons, this document specifies a normative mapping between a label, which represents a Facility, and the corresponding numeric value. This label could be used in, for example, SNMP Manager user interfaces. The label itself is often semantically meaningless because it is impractical to attempt to enumerate all possible Facilities, and many daemons and processes do not have an explicitly assigned Facility code or label. For example, there is no Facility label corresponding to an HTTP service. An HTTP service implementation might log messages as coming from, for example, 'local7' or 'uucp'. This is typical current practice, and originators, relays, and collectors can be configured to properly handle this situation. For improved accuracy, an application can also include an APP-NAME structured data element. Note that operating system mechanisms for configuring syslog, such as syslog.conf, have not yet been standardized and might use different sets of Facility labels and/or mapping between Facility labels and Facility codes than the MIB. In particular, the labels corresponding to Facility codes 4, 10, 13, and 14, and the code corresponding to the Facility label 'cron' are known to vary across different operating systems. To distinguish between the labels corresponding to Facility codes 9 and 15, a label of 'cron2' is assigned to the Facility code 15. This list is not intended to be exhaustive; other differences might exist, and new differences might be introduced in the future. The mapping specified here MUST be used in a MIB network management interface, even though a particular syslog implementation might use a different mapping in a different network management interface.",

For interoperability and backwards-compatibility reasons, this document specifies a normative mapping between a label, which represents a Severity level, and the corresponding numeric value. This label could be used in, for example, SNMP Manager user interfaces. The label itself is often semantically meaningless because it is impractical to attempt to strictly define the criteria for each Severity level, and the criteria that is used by syslog originators is, and has historically been, implementation-dependent. Note that operating system mechanisms for configuring syslog, such as syslog.conf, have not yet been standardized and might use different sets of Severity labels and/or mapping between Severity labels and Severity codes than the MIB. For example, the foobar application might log messages as 'crit' based on some subjective criteria. Yet the operator can configure syslog to forward these messages, even though the criteria for 'crit' may differ from one originator to another. This is typical current practice, and originators, relays, and collectors can be configured to properly handle this situation.",
