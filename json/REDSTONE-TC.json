The DESCRIPTION clause for an object of this type must identify the associated interface table. A GET of this object returns the next available ifIndex value to be used to create an entry in the associated interface table; or zero, if no valid ifIndex value is available. This object also returns a value of zero when it is the lexicographic successor of a varbind presented in an SNMP GETNEXT or GETBULK request, for which circumstance it is assumed that ifIndex allocation is unintended. Successive GETs will typically return different values, thus avoiding collisions among cooperating management clients seeking to create table entries simultaneously. Unless specified otherwise by its MAX-ACCESS and DESCRIPTION clauses, an object of this type is read-only, and a SET of such an object returns a notWritable error. "

One approach is to identify such interfaces with a 2-tuple consisting of <IpAddress, ifIndex>, where only one of the pair is nonzero for a valid interface (IpAddress is nonzero for numbered interfaces, ifIndex is nonzero for unnumbered interfaces). As an alternative, this textual convention compresses the 2-tuple information into an IpAddress (32-bit) format a.b.c.d having the following interpretation: Format Interpretation IP Interface Type -------------------------------------------------------------- 0.0.0.0 'null' value 'none' or 'wildcard', etc. a.b.c.d, a != 0 IP Address Numbered 0.b.c.d ifIndex Unnumbered For the unnumbered case, the value of the ifIndex is given by (b * 65536) + (c * 256) + (d) A side-effect of this approach is that ifIndex values for IP network interfaces must fall in the range 1..16777215 (i.e. 24 bits).
