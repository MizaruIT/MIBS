The objects being cloned may either be special ones that express configuration information at the mechanism-specific level, or simply instance-specific ones that already exist at the time the cloning is done. The following values are defined: - other(1) - reusable(2): the conceptual row is available to be pointed to by mulitple RowPointer objects. - singleUse(3): a separate copy of the conceptual row is needed for each RowPointer object that points to it. Because it represents a capability of the managed sytsem, rather than something that is configurable, an object having this syntax SHOULD have MAX-ACCESS of 'read-only'."
