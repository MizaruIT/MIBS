Each definition of a concrete StationAddressType value must be accompanied by a definition of a textual convention for use with that StationAddressType.

    "description": "Denotes a generic Internet address. An StationAddress value is always interpreted within the context of an StationAddressType value. Every usage of the StationAddress textual convention is required to specify the StationAddressType object which provides the context. It is suggested that the StationAddressType object is logically registered before the object(s) which use the StationAddress textual convention if they appear in the same logical row. The value of an StationAddress object must always be consistent with the value of the associated StationAddressType object. Attempts to set an StationAddress object to a value which is inconsistent with the associated StationAddressType must fail with an inconsistentValue error. When this textual convention is used as the syntax of an index object, there may be issues with the limit of 128 sub-identifiers specified in SMIv2, STD 58. In this case, the object definition MUST include a 'SIZE' clause to limit the number of potential instance sub-identifiers."

The scope identifier (bytes 17-20) MUST NOT be present for global IPv6 addresses. For non-global IPv6 addresses (e.g. link-local or site-local addresses), the scope identifier MUST always be present. It contains a link identifier for link-local and a site identifier for site-local IPv6 addresses. The scope identifier MUST disambiguate identical address values. For link-local addresses, the scope identifier will typically be the interface index (ifIndex as defined in the IF-MIB, RFC 2233) of the interface on which the address is configured. The scope identifier may contain the special value 0 which refers to the default scope. The default scope may be used in cases where the valid scope identifier is not known (e.g., a management application needs to write a site-local StationIdIPv6 address without knowing the site identifier value). The default scope SHOULD NOT be used as an easy way out in cases where the scope identifier for a non-global IPv6 is known."
