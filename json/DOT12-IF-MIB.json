Training signals have been received. openFailure - Passed 24 error-free packets, but there is a problem, noted in the training configuration bits (dot12LastTrainingConfig). linkFailure - Training signals not received, or could not pass 24 error-free packets.

Note that sets of some other objects (e.g. dot12ControlMode) or external events (e.g. MAC protocol violations) may also cause training to be reinitiated on this interface. When training is initiated or reinitiated on an interface, the end node will send Training_Up to the master and initially go to the 'linkFailure' state and ifOperStatus will go to 'down'. When the master sends back Training_Down, dot12Status will change to the 'opening' state, and training packets will be transferred. After all of the training packets have been passed, dot12Status will change to 'linkFailure' if 24 consecutive error-free packets were not passed, 'opened' if 24 consecutive error-free packets were passed and the training configuration bits were OK, or 'openFailure' if there were 24 consecutive error-free packets, but there was a problem with the training configuration bits. When in the 'openFailure' state, the dot12LastTrainingConfig object will contain the configuration bits from the last training packet which can be examined to determine the exact reason for the training configuration failure. If training did not succeed (dot12Status is 'linkFailure' or 'openFailure), the entire process will be restarted after MAC_Retraining_Delay_Timer seconds. If training does succeed (dot12Status changes to 'opened'), ifOperStatus will change to 'up'.
