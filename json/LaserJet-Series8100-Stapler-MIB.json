Additional information: This object describes the action that is performed when the JOB-OUTPUT-AUTO-CONTINUE-TIMEOUT expires. The action performed by the CONTINUE object being set to eInitiateAction or the GO key being pressed on the control panel may cause different actions. See the CONTINUE object description for information on the actions that occur for those conditions. The cCancelJob item overrides the other two options, if it is set then the job will be canceled regardless of the other settings. If cJobCancel is not set then cBinFullOverride will cause the printer to use the overflow bin (Set by PML object OVERFLOW-BIN)in the case of a bin full condtion. If the cBinderAttentionOverride option is set then the finisher out warning will be displayed but ignored and jobs will continue to go to the finisher anyway. OUTBIN3 is the topmost bin on the output device. This bin replaces the left output bin on the base printer. OUTBIN4 through OUTBIN8 are the additional 5 regular bins supplied by the MBM5S device. OUTBIN9 is the stapler unit and is the lowest bin in the device. NOTE: Because HP is marketing a device with a max of 7 bins (MBM5S) the OUTBINn-OVERRIDE-MODE objects are 3-9 but the external device specification requires support of up to 315 output bins. Therefore if these bins exist above 7, then the coresponding objects will also exist OUTBIN10-OVERRIDE-MODE through OUTBIN317-OVERRIDE-MODE. The data for this object is stored in NVRAM."

For example, for the built-in output bins, it is 177000 if prtOutputDimUnit is ePtenThousandthsOfInches or 450000 if prtOutputDimUnit is ePmicrometers. 177000 corresponds to the largest custom paper size a Yukon engine can handle. 170000 is the length of Ledger paper, which is the largest an external device can handle, and 85000 is the feed dimension of LETTER paper, which is the largest size the stapler can handle."
