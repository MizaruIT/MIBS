-- Version :  1.1 PROPOSED 
-- Enterprise filter mib
-- Copyright (C) 2000 Paradyne Corporation.

-- Created by : Prakash Easwar

--  CHANGE HISTORY
--
--  04/27/00 Prakash Easwar
--  1) Top level oid changes
--  2) added support for filter injection traps (moved the ones that
--     were deprecated from hot_xdsl.mib to this mib
--
-- 11/13/01 Dragana Gough
--  1) Added common filter configuration table for ethernet and ip
--     filters (sysDevFilterConfigTable) that looks similar to
--     sysDevIpFilterConfigTable. Added object Type.
-- 
-- 11/15/01 Dragana Gough
--  1) Added layer 2 filter rule table. Added common binding
--     table and new scalar object for index next search.
--
-- 01/11/01 Dragana Gough
-- 1) updated tables (Filter, rules and binding tables)
--
-- 07/30/02 Dragana Gough
-- 1) Added new sysDevL3FilterRuleConfigTable
--
-- 08/14/02 Dragana Gough
-- 1) Updated CHANGE HISTORY
-- 2) Depricated sysDevIpFilterRuleConfigTable
-- 3) Added (3) 'none' to sysDevL3FilterRuleSrcAddrAction
--    and sysDevL3FilterRuleDestAddrAction
-- 4) Changed sysDevL3FilterRuleName display string limit
--    to 255 from 12
-- 5) Added description to RuleName (unique name recommended)
--    and SrcPortNum and DestPortNum (if out-range or in-range 
--    CompType than this is start of range)
-- 6) Added description to objects that provide Next RuleIndex and
--    next FilterIndex

-- Common Filter sub group.
-- Configure filter table
-- Rule table
-- Binding table
--********************************************************************
-- The sysDevFilterConfigTable is used to create new filters.
-- To create new filter, filter index, filter name, type and 
-- and default action are neccessary to be specified. Next the 
-- user should create rules that will be attached to his filter. 
-- To create rule user should use L2 or L3, L4 FilterRuleTable)
-- depending on what type of rules user needs to create. To create
-- L2 (layer two) rule user needs to specify rule index, rule name, 
-- ether type (RFC 1700) and frame type that will be accepted. 
-- The user should also configure what action should be taken if  
-- the rule is matched to a frame. The ether type can be a range
-- of hex numbers (2bytes) so range objects should be used. 
-- Next the rule should be bound to one or more filters that are 
-- created. This binding is done by using FilterToRule binding 
-- table. This table is indexed by rule index and
-- filter index. Next the filter-rule binding (completed filter) 
-- should be bound to an interface by using FilterBindingTable. 
-- This table is indexed by ifIndex (interface we want filter 
-- bound to), filter index and direction that filter/rule 
-- combination is applied to (inboudn, outbound and inboundoutbound).
-- After this step the filter will take in effect and every 
-- packet on this interface will be examined for rule or set of  
-- rules that are bound to this filter. Filter should not be 
-- bound to an interface if the rule is not bound to a filter.
-- it can be done but the default action will take in effect 
-- and every packet will be checked. The rule cannot be deleted  
-- until all filter-rule bindings for this filter are deleted.
-- The rule cannot be deleted until all filter-interface 
-- bindings for this filter are disabled.
