--    The MIB module for IGMP Snooping feature. 
--    
--     Internet Group Management Protocol (IGMP) is the protocol used 
--     by IPv4 end hosts to indicates their interest in receiving 
--     multicast traffic for certain multicast groups to neighboring 
--     multicast routers. Version 3 of IGMP adds support for source 
--     base filtering; which means the end hosts can specifically 
--     indicate to receive or not-receive multicast packets from 
--     specific source addresses. This information is used by the 
--     multicast routers to restrict forwarding of multicast traffic 
--     for the host.
--    
--     IGMPv3 Snooping is a switch protocol. A switch that implements 
--     IGMPv3 Snooping listens to the IGMP messages exchanged between 
--     the hosts and router, then provides selective transmission of 
--     multicast traffic based on source lists contained in the 
--     messages. It also provides selective transmission of multicast 
--     data based on source IP address onto the ports that are 
--     interested.
