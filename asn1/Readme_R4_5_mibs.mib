README for R4.5 MIB support

Release 4.5 supports the same proprietary MIBs as in R4.0 with no changes.  
The R4.0 versions of the following MIBs should be used:

• Rel 4_0 Call Server trap.mib
• Rel 4_0 IP Line trap-UPDATED.mib
• Rel 4_0 Signaling Server trap.mib 
• Rel 4_0 qos.mib (also known as the Zonetrafficrpt.mib)

A number of standard MIB-II MIBs are supported in R4.5.  
Support of these MIBs varies by device and only portions of the MIB may be implemented.  

Supported MIBs include:

• System group (RFC 1213)
• Interface group (RFC 2863)
• IP group (RFC 2011)
• UDP group (RFC 2013)
• TCP group (RFC 2012)
• ICMP group (RFC 792)
• SNMP group (RFC 3418)
• Entity group (RFC 2737)
• Host Resources group (RFC 2790)

Refer to the R4.5 SNMP NTP 553-3001-519 for further details of coverage for all MIBs.
