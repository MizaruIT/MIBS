    DESCRIPTION
        "This MIB module is for configuring and monitoring SAN (Storage
        Area Networks) aggregation group related MIB objects.

        This MIB can be used to add or delete a SAN aggregation group,
        and make one or more FC (Fiber Channel) ports join or leave the
        group, as well as show their states."

    DESCRIPTION
        "A list of values concerning the member ports in a SAN
        aggregation group.

        Each 4 octets within this value list specifies a member
        in a SAN aggregation group.
        A zero-length string value means this list has no member,
        and the maximum length of this string depends on the maximum
        number of members a SAN aggregation supports."

        "List of member's ifIndex in the current SAN aggregation group.

        If there is no member in the SAN aggregation group, the list
        length should be zero.  Otherwise each member's ifIndex value
        occupies 4 octets.  The greatest length of this list depends
        on the maximum number of members a SAN aggregation group
        supports, which can be customized and therefore is not a fixed
        value.

        When getting the group members' ifIndexes, the result was sorted
        in ascending order of ifIndex values.  However, when setting the
        group members' ifIndexes, the sequence of ifIndex values is not

         is consistent with the 'get' result of 'h3cSanAggMemberList'.

         The explanation of this value's length is as same as the
         'h3cSanAggMemberList'.

         Each member's state value occupies 4 octets.  The value specifications
         are listed as follows:
         1: This member hasn't passed the link negotiation.
         2: This member has passed the link negotiation but has not been
