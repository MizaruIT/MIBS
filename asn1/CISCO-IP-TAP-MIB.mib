--    This module manages Cisco's intercept feature for IP.
--    
--    This MIB is used along with CISCO-TAP2-MIB to
--    intercept IP traffic. CISCO-TAP2-MIB along with
--    specific filter MIBs like this MIB replace 
--    CISCO-TAP-MIB.
--    
--    To create an IP intercept, an entry citapStreamEntry 
--    is created which contains the filter details. An entry
--    cTap2StreamEntry of CISCO-TAP2-MIB is created, which is
--    the common stream information for all kinds of 
--    intercepts and type of the specific stream is set to
--    ip in this entry.

        fields may be supported:
            tapEnable:   set if table entries with
                         cTap2StreamInterceptEnable set to 'false'
                         are used to pre-screen packets for intercept;
                         otherwise these entries are ignored.
            interface:   SNMP ifIndex Value may be used to select
                         interception of all data crossing an
                         interface or set of interfaces.
            ipV4:        IPv4 Address or prefix may be used to select
                         traffic to be intercepted.
            ipV6:        IPv6 Address or prefix may be used to select
                         traffic to be intercepted.
            l4Port:      TCP/UDP Ports may be used to select traffic
                         to be intercepted.
            dscp:        DSCP (Differentiated Services Code Point) may
                         be used to select traffic to be intercepted.
            voip:        packets belonging to a voice session may
                         be intercepted using source IPv4 address and
                         source UDP port."

    ACCESS not-accessible
    STATUS mandatory
    DESCRIPTION
        "The Intercept Stream IP Table lists the IPv4 and IPv6 streams
        to be intercepted.  The same data stream may be required by
        multiple taps, and one might assume that often the intercepted
        stream is a small subset of the traffic that could be
        intercepted.
        
        
        This essentially provides options for packet selection, only
        some of which might be used. For example, if all traffic to or
        from a given interface is to be intercepted, one would
        configure an entry which lists the interface, and wild-card
        everything else.  If all traffic to or from a given IP Address
        is to be intercepted, one would configure two such entries
        listing the IP Address as source and destination respectively,
        and wild-card everything else.  If a particular voice on a
        teleconference is to be intercepted, on the other hand, one
        would extract the multicast (destination) IP address, the
        source IP Address, the protocol (UDP), and the source and
        destination ports from the call control exchange and list all
        necessary information.
        
        
        The first index indicates which Mediation Device the
        intercepted traffic will be diverted to. The second index
        permits multiple classifiers to be used together, such as
        having an IP address as source or destination. The value of the
        second index is that of the stream's counter entry in the 
        cTap2StreamTable.
        
        Entries are added to this table via citapStreamStatus in 
        accordance with the RowStatus convention."

    SYNTAX INTEGER(-2..2147483647)
    ACCESS read-write
    STATUS mandatory
    DESCRIPTION
        "The ifIndex value of the interface over which traffic to be
        intercepted is received or transmitted. The interface may be
        physical or virtual. If this is the only parameter specified,
        and it is other than -2, -1 or 0, all traffic on the selected
        interface will be chosen.
        
        
        If the value is zero, matching traffic may be received or
        transmitted on any interface.  Additional selection parameters
        must be selected to limit the scope of traffic intercepted.
        This is most useful on non-routing platforms or on intercepts
        placed elsewhere than a subscriber interface.
        
        
        If the value is -1, one or both of
        citapStreamDestinationAddress and citapStreamSourceAddress
        must be specified with prefix length greater than zero.
        Matching traffic on the interface pointed to by ipRouteIfIndex
        or ipCidrRouteIfIndex values associated with those values is
        intercepted, whichever is specified to be more focused than a
        default route.  If routing changes, either by operator action
        or by routing protocol events, the interface will change with
        it. This is primarily intended for use on subscriber interfaces
        and other places where routing is guaranteed to be
        symmetrical.
        
        
        In both of these cases, it is possible to have the same packet
        selected for intersection on both its ingress and egress
        interface.  Nonetheless, only one instance of the packet is
        sent to the Mediation Device.
        
        
        If the value is -2, packets belonging to a Voice over IP (VoIP)
        session identified by citapStreamSourceAddress, 
        citapStreamSourceLen and citapStreamSourceL4PortMin may be 
        intercepted, as a specific voice session can be identified 
        with source IP address and udp port number. Other selection 
        parameters may be not considered, even if they are set by 
        the Mediation Device.
        
        
        This value must be set when creating a stream entry, either to
        select an interface, to select all interfaces, or to select the
        interface that routing chooses. Some platforms may not
        implement the entire range of options."
