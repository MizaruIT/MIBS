--    Cisco User Agent Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) 
--     MIB module.  SIP is an application-layer signalling
--     protocol for creating, modifying and terminating
--     multimedia sessions with one or more participants.
--     These sessions include Internet multimedia conferences
--     and Internet telephone calls.  SIP is defined in 
--     RFC 2543 (March 1999).  
--    
--     This MIB is defined for the management of SIP User 
--     Agents (UAs).  A User Agent is an application which 
--     contains both a User Agent Client (UAC) and a User 
--     Agent Server (UAS).   A UAC is an application that 
--     initiates a SIP request.  A UAS is an application that 
--     contacts the user when a SIP request is received and 
--     that returns a response on behalf of the user.  The 
--     response accepts, rejects, or redirects the request.
--    
--     A SIP transaction occurs between a client and a server 
--     and comprises all messages from the first request sent
--     from the client to the server up to a final (non-1xx) 
--     response sent from the server to the client.

        "This object will reflect the version of SIP supported by this 
         user agent.  It will follow the same format as SIP version 
         information contained in the SIP messages generated by this

         will return 'SIP/2.0' as dictated by RFC 2543."

    DESCRIPTION
        "This object will specify the transport protocol the SIP user

    DESCRIPTION
        "This object will specify address of the User Location 
         Server (ULS) being used to resolve the location of end 
         points.  This could be a Domain Name Server (DNS) or a 
         SIP proxy/redirect server.
        
         The format of the address follows the IETF service location 
         protocol. The syntax is as follows:
        
            mapping-type:type-specific-syntax
        
         the mapping-type specifies a scheme for mapping the matching 
         dial string to a target server. The type-specific-syntax is 
         exactly that, something that the particular mapping scheme can
         understand.  For example,
            Session target           Meaning
            ipv4:171.68.13.55:1006   The session target is the IP 
                                     version 4 address of 171.68.13.55 
                                     and port 1006.
            dns:pots.cisco.com       The session target is the IP host 
                                     with dns name pots.cisco.com.
        
         The valid Mapping type definitions for the peer follow:
            ipv4  - Syntax: ipv4:w.x.y.z:port or  ipv4:w.x.y.z 
            dns   - Syntax: dns:host.domain."
